// Durable Object shell for the official phase.rs lobby broker.
//
// This is a THIN imperative shell around the compiled Rust `lobby-broker` core
// (lobby-worker/broker-wasm -> broker-wasm-pkg). All protocol parsing, dispatch,
// reservations, capacity caps, build-commit gating and staleness reaping live in
// Rust — the SAME code the native phase-server runs (extracted in Phase A), so
// the two deployments behave identically by construction. The shell only:
//   - owns the WebSocket Hibernation lifecycle + DO storage,
//   - forwards raw frames into `WasmBroker.handle`,
//   - interprets the returned `Outbound` side effects over its transport,
//   - snapshots the broker to storage after mutations (a hibernated DO loses
//     in-memory state), and
//   - drives the reaper from a DO alarm (no tokio interval in a Worker).
// Public-lobby name moderation is intentionally applied here, not in the shared
// Rust broker, so self-hosted native servers keep their own policy surface.
//
// Mirrors the engine -> engine-wasm -> React-adapter pattern: the WASM owns the
// logic, the host language is a serialization boundary with zero game logic.

  /** Fetch and read the announced host's info document under one timeout.
   *

   *  `AbortSignal.timeout`: the abort tears down the response body stream as
   *  well as the connection, so a server that trickles bytes throws inside the
   *  reader rather than hanging past the timeout. Nothing throws out of here —
   *  the announcer gets a 4xx, never a 5xx.
   *
   *  Not following redirects is load-bearing twice over. The question this
   *  fetch asks is whether THIS host serves an info document matching THIS
   *  announcement, and a redirect answers a different question — some other
   *  host does — so following one would verify the wrong server even with no
   *  attacker present. It also closes the pivot: announcing is open by design
   *  (see the charter), so a follower would let any caller aim the verifier at
   *  a public hostname that redirects wherever it likes. Failing closed on a
   *  redirect keeps the destination equal to the announced one.
   *
   *  `redirect: "manual"` is how that is spelled on Workers: the runtime
   *  refuses `redirect: "error"` at the call, throwing
   *  `TypeError: Invalid redirect value, must be one of "follow" or "manual"`,
   *  which this method's catch would report as an unreachable host for every
   *  announcement including the good ones. Under `"manual"` a 3xx arrives as
   *  an ordinary non-ok response with the redirect NOT taken, so the `ok`
   *  test below is what refuses it.
   *
   *  What this deliberately does NOT do is resolve the hostname and reject
   *  private, loopback or link-local addresses. Workers exposes no DNS
   *  resolution API and no connection-time hook, so that check cannot be
   *  written here; the platform's own edge is what keeps a Worker fetch off
