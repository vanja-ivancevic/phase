# Phase 58 — Custom ("Design Your Own") Format Engine — CONTEXT

## Why this matters

phase.rs today models formats as a **closed, compile-time `GameFormat` enum**
(`crates/engine/src/types/format.rs`). That is exactly the right shape for the
fixed roster of *official* formats (Standard, Commander, Premodern, …): typed,
exhaustively matched, audited, version-controlled. It is the *wrong* shape for
**player/operator-authored custom formats**, whose card pools, banned/restricted
lists, and alternate-rule toggles are open-ended data that must not require an
engine recompile and a new enum variant per format.

The goal of this phase is to design a **general, data-driven custom-format
layer** that coexists with the closed enum, and to validate that layer by
expressing **four Eternal Central (EC) retro formats as bundled preset data on
top of it**:

- Old School 93-94
- Old School 95
- Middle School
- Classic Magic

The four EC formats are the *proof*, not the *point*. The deliverable that
survives is the general engine; the four formats are its first four data
instances. Per this repo's CLAUDE.md "build for the class, not the card"
principle, we build the format *class*, then instantiate the four as data — we
do **not** hardcode four new `GameFormat` variants.

## Maintainer input — resolves the delivery-surface question (Open item 1)

A maintainer (matthewevans), given an informal, non-technical description of
this proposal, independently converged on: *"Something like 'FFA that's super
flexible and you can save a configuration as a custom format?'"* — i.e., start
from the existing flexible multiplayer format (Free-for-All), let a host tune
its knobs freely in the lobby they already use, and add a "save this as a
custom format" action, rather than picturing a from-scratch format-authoring
tool.

This does **not** replace the schema below — it resolves *which axis is the
primary entry point* and confirms delivery surface (c) over (b)-first. The
custom-format schema (§ below, PLAN.md §1) always had two axes; this input
corrects an emphasis mistake in how they were sequenced:

- **Axis A — structural/match config**: `starting_life`, `min_players`/
  `max_players`, `deck_size`, `singleton`, `range_of_influence`, `team_based`.
  These are **already `FormatConfig` fields today**
  (`crates/engine/src/types/format.rs:174-202`) and **already partially
  exposed** in the existing multiplayer lobby
  (`client/src/components/lobby/HostSetup.tsx` — starting life, player count,
  deck size are already host-adjustable there for a chosen built-in
  `GameFormat`). This is exactly what "FFA that's super flexible" names. The
  original PLAN.md draft treated this axis as an inherited afterthought
  ("structural params reuse `FormatConfig`'s existing fields (life/deck/etc.)")
  rather than a first-class part of `CustomFormatRules` — that was the gap.
- **Axis B — legality/era-rules config**: `legal_sets`, `banned`, `restricted`,
  `LegacyRuleSet` (mana burn, damage-on-stack, pre-M10 Wish,
  legend-rule scope). This is genuinely new data with no existing UI surface,
  and it's what actually makes the four EC formats *rules-correct* — no amount
  of tuning Axis A knobs produces a faithful Old School 93-94. This axis keeps
  every finding already in RESEARCH.md/CONTEXT.md/PLAN.md; none of that work
  is discarded. (`reprint_policy` is deliberately NOT listed here — as of
  maintainer review round 6, it lives on `CustomFormatDef`'s display-metadata
  side, not inside the resolved `CustomFormatRules` Axis A/B split at all.
  This paragraph originally listed it alongside the real Axis B fields when
  it was first written in round 1, before that move — flagged by maintainer
  review round 7 as a stale cross-reference and fixed here.)

**Resolution of Open item 1**: ship (c) — one `CustomFormatDef`/
`CustomFormatRules` schema — but enter it through Axis A first, via the
*existing* lobby (`HostSetup.tsx` + "save as custom format"), not a new
designer screen and not (b)-first typed-preset-only delivery. The four EC
formats remain the validating case for Axis B and may still ship as audited
typed presets (a banned list should be curated, not free-typed by a player),
but they are no longer the thing that must land *before* anything else is
useful — the Axis A save-flow is smaller, ships independently, and is useful
to every casual multiplayer table, not just old-school players. See PLAN.md §1
and §7 for the schema and sequencing changes this implies.

## Further narrowing Axis B's MVP — Swedish Old School over the four EC formats

The follow-up ask: building `LegacyRuleSet` end-to-end (mana burn drop-site
hook, the damage-uses-the-stack combat rework, pre-M10 Wish exile access,
legend-rule scope) is real engine work with real risk, and doing all of it up
front makes the MVP harder to test, not easier. Two formats narrow Axis B's
first slice to something with **zero new legacy-rule engine work**:

- **Premodern needs no work at all.** It is already a native, working
  `GameFormat` (`FormatConfig::premodern()`) — fully modern rules, a
  set-window-restricted legal pool. It validates nothing new about this
  design; it's cited here only as an existing precedent for "old(er) card
  pool + entirely modern rules," the same shape Swedish Old School turns out
  to have.
- **Swedish Old School 93/94** — a *different, real ruleset* from the four EC
  formats already researched, independently verified this session via
  `oldschool-mtg.blogspot.com/p/banrestriction.html` (fetched directly, not
  from memory):
  - **Legal sets**: Alpha, Beta, Unlimited, Arabian Nights, Antiquities,
    Legends, The Dark, "Summer Magic" — the same era pool EC's 93-94 uses.
  - **Banned list**: empty — no card is fully banned under Swedish rules.
  - **Restricted list** (verbatim, 25 cards, one-copy maximum — corrected
    from an initial miscount of 23 flagged by review; recounted directly
    against the enumerated names below): Ancestral
    Recall, Balance, Black Lotus, Braingeyser, Channel, Chaos Orb, Contract
    from Below, Darkpact, Demonic Tutor, Library of Alexandria, Mana Drain,
    Mind Twist, Mishra's Workshop, Mox Emerald, Mox Jet, Mox Pearl, Mox Ruby,
    Mox Sapphire, Regrowth, Sol Ring, Strip Mine, Tempest Efreet, Time Walk,
    Timetwister, Wheel of Fortune — a **different list from EC's 93-94**, not
    a duplicate (confirms Axis B's `restricted: Vec<CardName>` shape needs to
    be a real per-format list, not a shared constant).
  - **Ante cards**: "must be removed before play unless the tournament is
    specifically played for ante" (Bronze Tablet, Contract from Below,
    Darkpact, Demonic Attorney, Jeweled Bird, Rebirth, Tempest Efreet) — a
    third list-shaped rule distinct from banned/restricted, **not yet modeled
    anywhere in this schema**. Flagged as a real gap to resolve at
    implementation time (likely a third named list, or folded into `banned`
    conditionally on an `ante_enabled` toggle this proposal does not yet
    have) — do not silently drop it.
  - **Reprint policy**: the primary source does **not** state one explicitly
    (only "Only English versions are allowed in Oldschool") — a secondary
    source (`mtgoldframe.com`) claims no Revised-or-later reprints are
    allowed, but that was **not** independently confirmed against the primary
    rules page this session. Do not encode `ReprintPolicy::OriginalPrintingsOnly`
    for this preset without re-verifying against the primary source or asking
    the community directly — flagged open, not resolved.
  - **Legacy rules**: the primary source makes **no mention** of mana burn,
    damage-on-the-stack, old Wish templating, or a modified legend rule —
    the plain reading is that Swedish Old School uses fully **modern** rules
    on the restricted-era pool. This is structurally the same shape as the
    already-documented **Classic Legacy** validation example (above): old
    card pool, modern rule engine, `LegacyRuleSet` at its all-`false`/
    `Modern` defaults. It is a *second* independent confirmation that
    card-pool era and legacy-rules toggles are properly decoupled axes, and
    the cheapest possible Axis B instance to build and test — no
    `LegacyRuleSet` engine wiring is exercised at all.

**Revised sequencing implication** (see PLAN.md §8): Phase 1 ships the general
engine + Axis A lobby-save + **Swedish Old School as the only new Axis B
preset**, with `LegacyRuleSet` fields present in the schema (so the type is
future-proof) but never exercised by anything Phase 1 actually ships. Phase 2
is the four EC formats (which genuinely need mana burn, and for Middle
School/Classic Magic, damage-on-the-stack) plus the `LegacyRuleSet` engine
wiring those require. This is a re-sequencing, not a scope cut — all four EC
formats and the full legacy-rules axis remain the target; they simply move to
a phase 2 that ships once the schema and Axis A/Axis B mechanics are already
proven end-to-end by something smaller and testable.

## Maintainer review round 2 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans reviewed the previous head and requested changes on five
design-correctness grounds. All five are addressed in this revision; see the
cited PLAN.md sections for the actual schema/wiring changes.

1. **Axis-A unrestricted-legality bug (real, confirmed).** The evaluator design
   (PLAN.md §3) checked "legal iff a printing's set ∈ `legal_sets`" — an empty
   `Vec` (Axis A's default, since a lobby-saved format sets no restriction)
   makes every card fail, not none. Fixed: `legal_sets` is now
   `Option<Vec<SetCode>>` — `None` means unrestricted (every card passes the
   pool check), `Some(list)` means restricted to that list, matching this
   repo's own convention of using `Option<T>` over an ambiguous sentinel
   value (CLAUDE.md's `Option<ControllerRef>` example). See PLAN.md §1 and §3.
2. **`StructuralRules` was missing behavior-bearing `FormatConfig` fields
   (real, confirmed).** Re-read `FormatConfig`'s full field list
   (`types/format.rs:174-212`) directly rather than from memory. Fixed at the
   time: `StructuralRules` now includes `command_zone`,
   `commander_damage_threshold`, and `archenemy_player` (all independently
   meaningful, not derived). `uses_commander` is derived as
   `commander_damage_threshold.is_some()` rather than stored redundantly.
   `supplies_fixed_deck` is always `false` for `Custom` (no custom-format use
   case for an auto-supplied deck exists; flagged, not silently dropped, if
   that need ever arises). **Superseded by round 3, points 3 and 4 below**:
   `archenemy_player` turned out to be the wrong kind of field to save at all
   (removed, not just added-then-kept) and the `uses_commander` derivation
   above was itself incomplete (missing the `command_zone` conjunct).
   `allow_debug_actions` is correctly excluded — its own doc comment says
   it is "orthogonal to format," a session capability flag, not format
   identity. **New finding**: `sideboard_policy` is not a `FormatConfig`
   field at all — it's a `GameFormat` *method*
   (`format.rs:270`, `fn sideboard_policy(self) -> SideboardPolicy`), so
   `GameFormat::Custom` has no derivation source for it the way built-in
   formats do. `StructuralRules` gains an explicit `sideboard_policy` field
   to fill that gap. See PLAN.md §1.
3. **No identity/persistence/transport contract for a lobby-saved format
   (real, confirmed — the largest gap).** The original design conflated two
   different identity concerns: (a) how a resolved ruleset is agreed on by
   both peers *in one active game*, and (b) how a *named, reusable* saved
   format persists for one player across many future games. (a) was already
   solved — `FormatConfig.custom_rules` carries the full resolved
   `CustomFormatRules` payload, not a lookup key, so a peer never needs to
   already know a format by ID to play it. (b) was never designed. Resolved
   by explicitly separating them: the engine's `CustomFormatId` stays a
   lightweight, `Copy`, per-`GameState` transport tag (stable/well-known only
   for the registry-backed EC/Swedish presets; an ad-hoc lobby save can use a
   fixed sentinel value, since the full payload — not the ID — is what
   travels and is interpreted). A player's "my saved formats" library is a
   **client-side-only** concern (local storage / profile-scoped, its own
   name+identity, never an engine or WASM type) that packages a
   `CustomFormatRules` value at game-start time. This also resolves the
   version-skew question: an older client that doesn't know the
   `GameFormat::Custom` enum variant at all can't be rescued by
   `serde(default)` on the payload (the failure is at the enum-variant level,
   not the payload level) — flagged as a real, explicit compatibility check
   the lobby-join flow needs (reject with a clear message, don't crash on
   deserialization), not something this schema revision can silently fix.
   See PLAN.md §1 (new subsection) and §7.
4. **Mana-burn behavioral/timing error (real, confirmed against this engine's
   own code and CR text, and against direct correction: mana burn keys off
   crossing a real MTG *phase* boundary, not the engine's finer-grained
   `Phase` enum, which flattens MTG's steps and phases into one 11-variant
   list — e.g. `DeclareAttackers` → `DeclareBlockers` is a step transition
   within the Combat phase, not a phase-end, even though the engine's own
   `Phase` enum treats every one of those as a variant transition).**
   Verified two things directly this session, not from memory:
   - The obsolete-rules glossary entry "Mana Burn (Obsolete)": "unspent
     mana caused a player to **lose life**" — life loss, not damage. The
     original PLAN.md/RESEARCH.md draft's "deal that many damage" framing
     was wrong.
   - The engine already has a generic, existing mechanism for exactly this
     shape: `player_unspent_mana_loss_causes_life_loss`
     (`static_abilities.rs:1237`, backed by `StaticMode::UnspentManaLossCausesLifeLoss`)
     is checked inside `apply_empty_mana_pool_event` (`turns.rs`, doc comment:
     "CR 106.4 + CR 703.4q: Apply the final replacement-ordered mana
     dispositions as the step or phase ends, then apply one aggregate
     Yurlok-class life-loss event") — this fires on **every** `Phase` enum
     transition (both true steps and true phases, per modern CR 500.5),
     which is correct for the existing Yurlok-class static ability but too
     fine-grained for old-school mana burn, which must fire only when
     actually leaving one of the 5 real MTG phases (Beginning, Precombat
     Main, Combat, Postcombat Main, Ending) — not on every step within one.
   See PLAN.md §4 for the corrected wiring: a phase-group boundary check
   gating a *second*, independent contribution to the same life-loss event
   mechanism, alongside (not merged into) the existing Yurlok-class check.
5. **Preset data inconsistencies (real, confirmed and fixed).** Swedish Old
   School's restricted list was mislabeled "23 cards" when 25 are actually
   enumerated (fixed above); PLAN.md's `swedish_old_school()` sketch had
   dropped "Summer Magic" from the legal-sets list that this document already
   stated (fixed in PLAN.md §2). Classic Magic's restricted list was labeled
   "(37)" but enumerates 44 names in RESEARCH.md — recounted directly against
   the verbatim list and fixed to "(44)" in both RESEARCH.md and PLAN.md §2.

## Maintainer review round 3 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 2's fix (commit `b6cf09b89`) and found the
round-2 fix itself incomplete or wrong on five points. All five are addressed
below, each re-verified directly against the cited engine source this
session (not from memory, and not just accepting the review at face value —
every claim below was independently confirmed against the actual code before
being treated as correct).

1. **Round 2's mana-burn fix gated the wrong operation (real, confirmed —
   the most substantive miss).** Round 2 only gated the LIFE-LOSS check to
   real phase-group boundaries; it left the underlying `EmptyManaPool` event
   firing (and draining the pool) on **every** `Phase` transition, exactly as
   before. Since the pool empties every step regardless, there is no unspent
   mana left BY THE TIME a phase-group boundary is reached — round 2's flag
   check would have fired against an already-empty pool and done nothing.
   Also confirmed: `state.phase = next` (`turns.rs`, in `enter_phase`) is set
   near the *top* of the function, so any code running after it that reads
   `state.phase` sees the destination, not the phase being left — a
   "current vs. next" check placed carelessly would silently compare the
   wrong pair.

   **Real fix, reusing an existing mechanism rather than inventing pool
   suppression from scratch.** The engine already has exactly the needed
   shape: `ManaExpiry` (`types/mana.rs:1509`) has `EndOfTurn` and
   `EndOfCombat` variants — `EndOfCombat`'s own doc comment: "Mana persists
   through combat steps but drains at EndCombat → PostCombatMain," used by
   Firebending. That is precisely "persist through this phase's internal
   steps, drain at the real phase-group boundary," already built and
   tested — just special-cased to the Combat phase-group only. The fix
   generalizes it rather than inventing something new: add
   `ManaExpiry::EndOfPhaseGroup` (a third variant, not five new
   `EndOfBeginning`/`EndOfPrecombatMain`/etc. variants — it resolves against
   whichever phase-group is active when checked, exactly as `EndOfCombat`
   and `EndOfTurn` already do without parameterizing which combat/turn).
   When a format's `LegacyRuleSet.mana_burn` is set, newly-added mana units
   are tagged `expiry: Some(EndOfPhaseGroup)` instead of `None`. The existing
   expiry-clearing logic (the generalization of
   `clear_expired_end_of_combat_retention_markers`) converts them to
   ordinary (`None`-expiry) units once the phase-group actually changes,
   letting them flow into that transition's *already-firing* `EmptyManaPool`
   event as `Drop` decisions — the same event the engine unconditionally
   fires every transition, so no new suppression path is needed. Because
   under this scheme nothing drops except at real phase-group boundaries,
   the drop count at that point *is* the burn amount — apply it as **life
   loss** (not damage, per round 2's already-verified CR finding) at the
   same point the pipeline already aggregates the Yurlok-class check,
   independent of it. This also resolves the "life loss can defer through
   replacement handling" concern: it reuses the *same* aggregation point the
   pipeline already uses for pauses/choices (Kruphix/Horizon Stone), rather
   than adding a second, unsynchronized computation. See PLAN.md §4.
2. **`StructuralRules.sideboard_policy` had no accessor or migration path
   (real, confirmed).** `GameFormat::sideboard_policy()` (`format.rs:270`) is
   an exhaustive match over the ~23 built-in variants with no access to
   `FormatConfig` — it cannot read `custom_rules` even in principle, so a
   `Custom(_)` arm there can only be `unreachable!()` with a doc comment
   pointing elsewhere. The two production consumers
   (`deck_loading.rs:681`, `match_flow.rs:357`, confirmed by direct read —
   and any other call site of `.format.sideboard_policy()` found by a repo
   grep at implementation time, not just these two) call that method
   directly, so a saved format's policy would be silently ignored exactly as
   flagged. Fixed: a new canonical accessor,
   `FormatConfig::sideboard_policy(&self) -> SideboardPolicy`, with a
   `GameFormat::Custom(_)` arm reading
   `self.custom_rules.as_ref().expect(...).structural.sideboard_policy` and
   every other format delegating to `self.format.sideboard_policy()`. All
   current call sites migrate from `state.format_config.format
   .sideboard_policy()` to `state.format_config.sideboard_policy()`. See
   PLAN.md §1 and §3.
3. **`archenemy_player: Option<PlayerId>` must not be a saveable structural
   field (real, confirmed).** Read `FormatConfig::archenemy_player()` and
   `validate_for_player_count` (`format.rs:658-670`) directly: the seat index
   is derived from `topology()` for the CURRENT game and is validated against
   THAT game's actual player count (`archenemy.0 >= player_count` → error). A
   value persisted in a reusable saved format could reference a seat that
   doesn't exist, or a different player, in a later game with different
   seating. Fixed: removed `archenemy_player` from `StructuralRules`
   entirely — Axis A does not support the Archenemy one-vs-many topology at
   all (it is a different `FormatTopology` shape, not an independent config
   knob layered on `IndividualSeats`, which is what FFA-style Axis A targets).
   This is an explicit scope exclusion, not a silent drop — a future
   topology-aware design would need its own analysis, out of scope here. See
   PLAN.md §1.
4. **`uses_commander` derivation used only one of two required conditions
   (real, confirmed).** Read `GameFormat::uses_commander()`
   (`format.rs:365-380`) directly: for built-in formats it's a hardcoded
   per-variant match, but its own doc comment states the actual INVARIANT it
   encodes — true "for every format whose `FormatConfig` has both
   `command_zone: true` and a non-`None` `commander_damage_threshold`."
   Round 2's derivation used the threshold alone, dropping the
   `command_zone` conjunct. Fixed: for `GameFormat::Custom`,
   `FormatConfig.uses_commander` is computed at construction time (in
   `from_lobby_config` / preset constructors, since `GameFormat`'s own
   method has no access to `FormatConfig` fields to check either condition)
   as `structural.command_zone && structural.commander_damage_threshold
   .is_some()` — both conditions, matching the stated invariant exactly.
   Added a test for the mismatched cases (`command_zone: true` alone,
   `commander_damage_threshold: Some(_)` alone) asserting `false` for each.
   See PLAN.md §1 and §6.
5. **Declared policies that are unenforced or unresolved must block
   registration, not just exist as data (real, confirmed, two parts).**
   - `ReprintPolicy` is declared on `LegalityRules` but never consumed
     anywhere in §3's evaluator algorithm — a card passes the pool check
     based on legal-set membership alone, regardless of which `ReprintPolicy`
     the preset declares. This connects to, rather than duplicates, the
     already-flagged Open item 2 (printing/frame-data gap): enforcement needs
     that same engine-vs-frontend printing cross-reference work.
   - `LegendRuleScope::PreM14AnyController` was already flagged (see the
     "Lost Legacy 606" note below) as a possible conflation of two different
     historical mechanics under one name — an immediate "bury on resolution"
     era (Legends 1994) versus a later, still-pre-M14 continuous SBA-based
     global check — never resolved via dedicated rules-history research.
   - **New rule this round, to prevent this class of gap recurring**: a
     preset must not be registered/exposed as a selectable format until
     every legality/legacy field it declares is BOTH fully specified AND
     actually consumed by the evaluator/engine at an authoritative seam.
     Concretely: `swedish_old_school()` (phase 1) must not ship as
     selectable until its own still-open reprint-policy question (Open item
     6, above) resolves, since it declares a `ReprintPolicy` today with no
     enforcement path. No phase-2 EC preset may ship claiming
     `LegendRuleScope::PreM14AnyController` until that conflation resolves —
     moot today since all four default it to `Modern`, but binding on any
     future preset that would turn it on. See PLAN.md §2 and §7.

- **`GameFormat` is a closed `Copy` enum** with ~23 variants, threaded through
  many exhaustive matches (`legality_format`, `sideboard_policy`,
  `grants_free_first_mulligan`, `uses_commander`, `supplies_fixed_deck`,
  `label`, `for_format`, plus `deck_validation.rs::format_compatibility_check`).
  Verified `format.rs` in full. Adding an *additive* variant is the established
  extension pattern (see the `GameFormat::Limited` prior art, phase 53).
- **Legality today is externally sourced per-card.** `card_db.rs:109` calls
  `normalize_legalities(&entry.legalities)`; the raw map comes from MTGJSON
  `AtomicCard.legalities` via the export binary (`bin/oracle_gen.rs:778`,
  `883`). `LegalityFormat::from_key` (`legality.rs:69`) **drops any key it does
  not recognize**. There is **no** `oldschool` / `middleschool` / `classic`
  variant in `LegalityFormat`, so even MTGJSON's `oldschool` key (if present) is
  silently discarded today. The existing test at `legality.rs:293-297`
  explicitly documents that unknown keys like `"oldschool"` are dropped. →
  **None of the four EC formats have any signal in the current pipeline.**
  Confirmed by reading `legality.rs`, `card_db.rs`, and `oracle_gen.rs`.
- **`set_gating.rs` does NOT fit** as a format-restriction mechanism. Confirmed
  by reading it in full: it is a `GATED_SETS`-env-var-driven, *generation-time*
  pre-release embargo tool that overrides a card's legalities to
  `all_formats_banned()`. It is narrow deployment tooling, not a runtime,
  general, per-format card-pool mechanism. Useful only as a *rough shape
  reference* for "how this codebase does deployment-level config", not an
  architecture to copy.
- **Set-membership data exists and is the right key.**
  `CardDatabase::printings_for(name) -> Option<&[String]>` (`card_db.rs:227`)
  returns the set codes a card was printed in. This is the building block a
  set-list-driven custom format needs.
- **`DeckCopyLimit::UpTo(1)` is the WRONG layer for a format restricted list**
  (see RESEARCH.md §4). The correct existing building block is the
  format-level restricted-list enforcer `restricted_copy_violations`
  (`deck_validation.rs:2462`), which already implements the CR 100.2b 1-copy
  ceiling generically.
- **Mana burn is small; "damage uses the stack" is large.** Verified hook
  points (RESEARCH.md §5). Mana burn is a localized addition at the mana-pool
  drop site. "Damage uses the stack" is a fundamental reversal of CR 510.2 and a
  deep combat/stack/priority rework.
- **Legend-rule scope change is REAL and the engine is hardcoded to modern; a
  legacy flag is SMALL — but no EC preset uses it.** Fully investigated
  (RESEARCH.md §10). The legend rule (introduced by *Legends* 1994, legal in
  93-94/95) was **global / any-controller** through 2013, then M14 (2013-07-13)
  made it **per-controller + choice** (current CR 704.5j). The engine's
  `check_legend_rule` (`sba.rs:902-956`) is hardcoded to the modern
  per-controller-with-choice form (loops per player, filters `controller ==
  player_id`, pauses with `WaitingFor::ChooseLegend`). Re-adding the pre-M14
  global-choiceless form is SMALL — it mirrors the existing `check_world_rule`
  (`sba.rs:1348`) shape and reuses the shared SBA departure mover. Modeled as a
  typed `LegendRuleScope { Modern, PreM14AnyController }` enum on `LegacyRuleSet`
  (not a bool). **HONEST CAVEAT:** EC's published rulesets do **not** list a
  legend-rule reversion (their only legacy exceptions are mana burn /
  damage-on-stack / wish), so all four EC presets default to `Modern`; the scope
  enum ships as a *general* historical-rules axis (like Block Constructed's
  `mana_burn`), not an EC-preset behavior. Planeswalker uniqueness needs no flag —
  the four pools end at Scourge (2003) and planeswalkers postdate that (Lorwyn
  2007). The planeswalker-uniqueness → legend-rule fold happened at **Ixalan
  (2017-09-28)**, not Dominaria 2018.
- **Pre-M10 Wish templating is small and is a REAL functional difference.**
  Fully investigated (RESEARCH.md §9). It reverts the M10 change that made exile
  an in-game zone (CR 400.11/400.11a): pre-M10, Wishes could retrieve an owned
  card removed from the game, not just from the sideboard. The engine already
  implements the modern (post-M10) Wish cycle generically
  (`Effect::SearchOutsideGame`, `OutsideGameSourcePool::Sideboard`) AND already
  implements owned-face-up-exile retrieval for the Karn/Coax class
  (`SideboardAndFaceUpExile` + tested collector/mover in
  `search_outside_game.rs`). The legacy flag is therefore a one-line pool-widening
  at one existing resolver hook — SMALL, not the "Medium" the first pass guessed.
  Flag renamed `pre_m10_wish_templating` → `pre_m10_wish_reaches_exile` (it is a
  pool-scope toggle, not a wording change).

## Maintainer review round 4 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 3's fix (commit `e1c6c1912`) and opened with
"several earlier design issues are improved" — none of round 3's five points
were re-flagged, confirming each was genuinely resolved rather than
resurfacing. Four new/deeper points were raised. Per direct instruction this
round, every point across ALL FOUR review rounds was re-audited against
current source before treating anything as settled — this surfaced one
additional real gap (`deck_validation.rs`'s `DeckCompatibilityRequest
.selected_format`) that nobody, including this document, had named yet.

1. **Custom format context handling was partial, and a malformed payload
   could panic (real, confirmed — the most substantive miss).** Round 3's
   `FormatConfig::sideboard_policy()` used `.expect("Custom format must
   carry custom_rules")` — a production panic path if `custom_rules` is
   ever `None` while `format == Custom(_)`. It also migrated only 2 call
   sites; a full grep this round for every non-test consumer of
   `.sideboard_policy()` / `.uses_commander()` on a bare `GameFormat` found
   SEVEN files: `companion.rs` (4 sites — round 4's own citation),
   `deck_loading.rs` (2), `match_flow.rs` (2), and, found independently this
   round and not named by any review, `deck_validation.rs` (5 sites,
   including `DeckCompatibilityRequest.selected_format: Option<GameFormat>`
   itself — a request struct with no `FormatConfig`/`custom_rules` field at
   all, meaning even a corrected accessor couldn't have helped these call
   sites without a signature change). Fixed: (a) fallible validation of the
   `format`/`custom_rules` invariant at every construction/ingestion point,
   rejecting inconsistent values before they can exist, so nothing
   downstream needs `.expect()`; (b) `sideboard_policy` becomes a STORED
   FIELD on `FormatConfig` — matching the pattern `uses_commander` and
   `supplies_fixed_deck` already use (confirmed via `format.rs:1512-1513`'s
   own consistency test), not a new pattern; (c) every real consumer
   migrates to read the resolved field, with signatures widened wherever
   they currently only carry a bare `GameFormat`. See PLAN.md §1.
2. **`from_lobby_config`'s `sideboard_policy` source was never actually
   specified (real, confirmed).** Round 3 added the field and the round-3
   accessor, but never stated how the conversion itself computes the value
   from a bare `&FormatConfig`. Fixed: explicit —
   `config.format.sideboard_policy()`, valid because `from_lobby_config`'s
   precondition is that its input's `format` is always built-in (re-saving
   an already-custom format is out of scope). See PLAN.md §2.
3. **`LegacyRuleSet`'s booleans should be typed enums, and no preset may
   ship in a "playable with a caveat" state (real, confirmed — the second
   part is a genuine scope tightening, not a bug fix).** `mana_burn`,
   `damage_uses_stack`, and `pre_m10_wish_reaches_exile` were bools; per
   CLAUDE.md's own bool-vs-enum principle each names a real two-value
   historical space (an obsolete pre-removal form vs. modern absence), so
   each becomes a typed enum (`ManaBurnPolicy`, `CombatDamageTiming`,
   `WishOutsideGameScope`) mirroring `LegendRuleScope`'s existing shape.
   Separately and more consequentially: this document's own §8/RESEARCH.md
   §6 said Middle School / Classic Magic would be "playable-with-caveat"
   until damage-on-stack lands. **Retracted, not merely superseded** — the
   preset-readiness gate (§7) now explicitly forbids any partial-fidelity
   registration. Real consequence: those two EC presets cannot ship as
   selectable until the LARGE combat-timing rework is fully done, full
   stop, not available-now-with-a-documented-gap as originally planned. See
   PLAN.md §1 and §7.
4. **Version-skew handling and `ReprintPolicy` enforcement both needed a
   concrete resolution, not a flag (real, confirmed).** Rounds 2-3 correctly
   identified both gaps but explicitly deferred designing them ("not
   designed in depth here"). Round 4 required an actual answer for each:
   - Version skew: this engine already has a working protocol-version gate
     (`server-core/src/protocol.rs`'s `PROTOCOL_VERSION` /
     `MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL`, confirmed this session to already "refuse to
     proceed on mismatch"). Resolution: bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION` when
     `GameFormat::Custom` ships, so an incompatible client is rejected at
     the EXISTING handshake gate — reusing proven infrastructure rather than
     inventing a custom-format-specific negotiation layer.
   - `ReprintPolicy` enforcement: two resolution paths, either sufficient —
     the general engine-vs-frontend printing cross-reference (Open item 2),
     or a one-preset verification pass scoped just to
     `swedish_old_school()`'s own restricted-list cards. Until either lands,
     the preset-readiness gate keeps this preset (and any other declaring a
     non-trivial `ReprintPolicy`) unregistered — the "explicitly narrow the
     proposal" branch review round 4 offered as an acceptable alternative to
     building the full model immediately.
   - Also fixed: two stale `pre_m10_wish_templating` references in
     RESEARCH.md (lines 417/442) that survived since round 1 despite
     PLAN.md already using the canonical `pre_m10_wish_reaches_exile` name
     throughout — a pure terminology-reconciliation miss, now consistent
     everywhere.

## Automated review pass (CodeRabbit) on the round-4 commit, addressed

Between round 4 and round 5, CodeRabbit (automated, not matthewevans) found
5 things on the round-4 commit, at least 3 real: (1) round 4's own rename to
`wish_scope: WishOutsideGameScope` didn't propagate to the
`search_outside_game` pseudocode, which still read the round-1
`pre_m10_wish_reaches_exile` bool name — a mistake introduced in the very
same round-4 commit that fixed the OTHER stale reference; (2)
`sideboard_policy`/`uses_commander` are plain serialized `FormatConfig`
fields that could diverge from `custom_rules` on a malformed payload — real
for built-in formats today too, not just Custom, so the fallible-validation
check was widened to cover both; (3) `DeckCompatibilityRequest` needs the
FULL `CustomFormatRules` at its Custom-dispatch call site, not the lighter
facts-only struct sufficient for `companion.rs`; (4) only `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
was bumped, not the separate `LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` that actually gates
the lobby handshake where format selection happens; (5)
`CombatDamageTiming::OnStack`'s doc comment mischaracterized historical
combat damage as a triggered ability rather than damage-as-a-stack-object
(RESEARCH.md §6 already had this right). Also strengthened the
preset-readiness gate from a documented convention into an actual
`custom_format_registry()`-level technical check, addressing a stricter
CodeRabbit reading without fully adopting its more extreme "remove
`ReprintPolicy`" suggestion, which went beyond what matthewevans himself had
asked for. See PLAN.md for the actual fixes.

## Maintainer review round 5 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed the commit that included both round-4's fixes and
the CodeRabbit-finding fixes above (head `4ce7df01e`) and opened with: "The
proposal now resolves the previously-requested custom-context, typed-policy,
compatibility, and no-caveated-preset concerns" — confirming round 4 in full.
Two new, narrower points remained:

1. **`StructuralRules.singleton` was declared but never enforced (real,
   confirmed).** The field existed since round 2's full-fidelity fix, but
   §3's deck-legality algorithm always called `copy_limit_violations(db,
   &counts, 4)` — never reading `singleton` at all — and there was no test
   for it. Fixed: `copy_limit_violations(db, &counts, if
   rules.structural.singleton { 1 } else { 4 })`. This is parameterizing an
   EXISTING call, not new logic — confirmed this round that every built-in
   singleton format already calls this same helper with `1`
   (`deck_validation.rs:929,1096,1335,1668,2215`) and the helper's own
   existing tests already prove card-intrinsic overrides (Relentless
   Rats/Nazgûl-shaped "any number" cards) compose correctly under a `1`
   limit — no new override-preservation logic needed, just reading the
   field. See PLAN.md §3 and §6.
2. **The registry gate covered only `LegacyRuleSet`'s four axes, not
   `ReprintPolicy` (real, confirmed — but the fix is a reframing, not a
   broadening).** Round 4's `IMPLEMENTED_LEGACY_AXES` mechanism was scoped
   to `LegacyRuleSet` only, so a preset could still register while declaring
   an unenforced `ReprintPolicy`. Rather than extending the gate to a field
   never designed to be independently enforceable, re-read this document's
   own original research (RESEARCH.md §3, written before any review round):
   it already concluded `ReprintPolicy`'s actual behavior is fully absorbed
   into `legal_sets` curation (a reprint in a non-legal set is already
   excluded by plain set-membership) and flagged only the finer frame/art
   distinction as a real, separate gap — which Open item 2 already tracks.
   Resolution: `reprint_policy` is documentation metadata, deliberately not
   consumed by the evaluator and deliberately NOT part of the
   registration-gate's enforcement surface, which only needs to cover
   fields that are actually behavior-bearing. `swedish_old_school()` is
   still gated on Open item 6 (getting the metadata value right so it
   doesn't mislead a future maintainer), but that's a documentation-accuracy
   blocker now, not a missing-enforcement one. This satisfies the "or
   keep/reduce `ReprintPolicy` to non-selectable/deferred metadata" branch
   review round 5 explicitly offered as acceptable. See PLAN.md §3 and §7.

## Maintainer review round 6 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 5's fix (commit `21a0a03b`) and confirmed the
singleton fix landed correctly — "now correctly use the existing
parameterized copy-limit helper" — with one remaining architecture
contract flagged as ambiguous, correctly:

1. **`ReprintPolicy` was left in an internally contradictory state (real,
   confirmed — round 5's fix was itself the bug this round found).** Round
   5 resolved `reprint_policy` to "documentation metadata, never consumed"
   but left the FIELD sitting inside `LegalityRules` (part of
   `CustomFormatRules`, the resolved payload that travels in
   `FormatConfig.custom_rules` and gets enforced) while a nearby comment
   from round 1 still said it "gates LEGALITY." Those are two incompatible
   claims about the same field's contract in the same document — a
   struct's shape is itself a claim ("this travels with and is part of the
   enforced ruleset"), and no amount of comment-level disclaiming changes
   what the type says. Resolved structurally, not documentarily: moved
   `reprint_policy` out of `CustomFormatRules`/`LegalityRules` entirely,
   onto a newly-sketched `CustomFormatDef` struct (previously only
   described in prose as "display metadata + CustomFormatRules," which is
   exactly the ambiguity that let this happen — round 6 gives it an actual
   type), alongside `label`/`short_label`/`description`. This is one of the
   two resolutions matthewevans offered ("move the declared intent to
   preset/document metadata outside `CustomFormatRules`/`LegalityRules`"),
   chosen over the other (building real engine-owned printing enforcement
   and gating registration on it) for the same reason round 5 already
   established: this document's own original research (RESEARCH.md §3)
   already showed the field's actual behavior is fully absorbed by
   `legal_sets` curation, so building separate enforcement would duplicate
   logic that already exists elsewhere. Every preset sketch, the
   preset-readiness gate's scope description, and the registry-gate
   reasoning were updated to reflect the field's new home — the gate no
   longer needs to "exempt" `reprint_policy`, since it isn't on the
   resolved-rules struct for the gate to see at all. See PLAN.md §1, §2,
   §3, and §7.

## Maintainer review round 7 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 6's fix (commit `5098e4bd`) and confirmed:
"Moving `ReprintPolicy` out of the resolved rules payload correctly resolves
the prior semantic contradiction" — the structural move itself was right.
One construction gap remained:

1. **Lobby-created formats had no legitimate `reprint_policy` value (real,
   confirmed).** Round 6 made `CustomFormatDef.reprint_policy` a required
   `ReprintPolicy` (not `Option`), but `from_lobby_config(name,
   &FormatConfig)` has no source for one — a lobby save has no authored
   paper-format reprint intent at all (it isn't modeling any published
   ruleset), so forcing any of the three real variants onto it would be
   fabricated metadata, not an honest gap the way `legal_sets: None` etc.
   already are for the same reason. Fixed: `reprint_policy:
   Option<ReprintPolicy>` — `None` for `from_lobby_config` (and, for now,
   for `swedish_old_school()` pending Open item 6), `Some(_)` with a real,
   sourced value for every other Axis B preset. Same `Option<T>`-over-
   forcing-a-value pattern this proposal already uses for `legal_sets` and
   `range_of_influence` — not a new convention introduced for this one
   field. Also fixed a stale cross-reference this round caught: CONTEXT.md's
   original round-1 "Axis B" field list still named `reprint_policy`
   alongside the genuinely resolved-legality fields, unchanged since before
   round 6 moved it. See PLAN.md §1, §2, and §6 for the schema, preset, and
   test changes.

## Maintainer review round 8 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 7's fix (commit `83eabc081`) and confirmed
`Option<ReprintPolicy>` "correctly gives lobby saves an honest `None`
value," with one construction gap remaining:

1. **`from_lobby_config` had no defined rule for `label`/`short_label`/
   `description` (real, confirmed).** `CustomFormatDef` requires all three
   non-optionally since round 6, but the constructor's signature (`name` +
   `&FormatConfig`) never specified how `short_label`/`description` are
   derived. Fixed: `label = name` directly; `short_label` = `name`'s first 3
   alphanumeric characters uppercased (the same convention the frontend
   already independently falls back to for any unrecognized format,
   `format.slice(0, 3).toUpperCase()` in `GameListItem.tsx` and others — not
   a new convention); `description` via a new
   `derive_structural_description(&StructuralRules)` helper mirroring
   built-in formats' existing comma-joined structural phrasing. Empty/
   whitespace-only `name` is rejected, consistent with round 2's "reject
   explicitly rather than silently drop data" posture. See PLAN.md §1 and
   §6.

## Maintainer review round 9 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 8's fix (commit `9698d1ac5`) and found the
round-8 fix incomplete at a deeper level:

1. **`CustomFormatDef`'s display metadata never reaches a running game
   (real, confirmed).** `SavedCustomFormat.name` is client-local-only by
   round 2's own identity design and never enters
   `CustomFormatRules`/`FormatConfig.custom_rules` — so once a game starts,
   there is no name to read. Worse than a missing-data problem:
   `GameFormat::label(self) -> &'static str` (`format.rs:395`) cannot
   return `CustomFormatDef.label` (a `String`) regardless of what's threaded
   in — a signature problem. Fixed: `label()` becomes
   `Cow<'static, str>`-returning; built-in variants unchanged
   (`Cow::Borrowed`); `Custom(id)` resolves via a `custom_format_registry()`
   lookup by id — a hit (Axis B, stable registry id) returns the real name,
   a miss (Axis A's ad-hoc sentinel id, never registered) returns a fixed
   `"Custom Format"` fallback. No new wire surface added; the real
   player-chosen name for an ad-hoc save stays exactly where round 2 always
   said it lives — the local picker, never promised at runtime.
2. **Second, independently-found instance of the same root cause.**
   `FormatConfig::for_format(bare GameFormat)` (`format.rs:1056`) is called
   for `.deck_size` at two real `deck_validation.rs` sites (confirmed by
   direct grep, not the doc comment's stale claimed "lobby broker" caller,
   which doesn't exist in the codebase today), silently returning a wrong
   default size for `Custom`. Fixed identically to the existing
   `sideboard_policy`/`uses_commander` pattern: an `unreachable!()` guard
   arm, with both call sites migrated to read
   `custom_rules.structural.deck_size` when present. See PLAN.md §1 and §6
   for both fixes and their required tests.

## Maintainer review round 10 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 9's fix (commit `6ec2f2adc`) and raised a
different, deeper-history finding:

1. **The rollout registers Old School 93-94/95 with no gate tied to their
   own source rules' printing-fidelity requirement (real, confirmed).**
   RESEARCH.md:34 cites the actual EC source: "non-foil reprints with
   original frame + art." `legal_sets` (set-code membership) cannot express
   this, and PLAN.md §8 schedules these two presets as registerable once
   mana burn lands alone — with no gate acknowledging the printing-fidelity
   axis at all, even though CONTEXT.md's own item 2 (above) already flagged
   it as a live, unresolved "needs a human decision" item. The plan and the
   open-items list had drifted out of sync with each other.
   **Resolved this round as follows — SUPERSEDED by round 11 below, kept
   here as the accurate historical record, not deleted:** legality
   enforcement not extended; the source rules' spirit honored instead by
   making `ArtChainEntry`'s existing `{type: "oldest"}` preference
   `legal_sets`-aware. Round 11 correctly rejected this — a display
   preference isn't a legality resolution — so this specific fix does not
   ship as part of resolving item 2; see round 11 below for what actually
   resolved it.

## Maintainer review round 11 — CHANGES_REQUESTED, addressed

matthewevans re-reviewed round 10's fix (commit `673e22366`) and rejected
its resolution directly:

1. **A display default cannot resolve a legality claim (real, confirmed —
   round 10's fix was itself the gap this round found).** "[T]he proposal
   replaces a source legality requirement with an optional display
   preference, so the EC Old School presets remain eligible for selection
   without rules-faithful printing enforcement... do not treat an optional
   rendering preference as a legality resolution." Correct: making
   `ArtChainEntry` legal-set-aware is a genuine, worthwhile improvement, but
   it's cosmetic — nothing stops a player from submitting a deck with a
   wrong-printing card regardless of what the client renders.
   **Resolved directly in discussion, not by picking one of the two options
   matthewevans offered (gate on future enforcement, or explicitly downgrade
   the claim) — a third answer grounded in existing precedent:** confirmed
   this round that `GameFormat::Premodern`'s legality
   (`LegalityFormat::Premodern`, `format.rs:243`) is oracle-card-level
   only — no built-in format in this engine has EVER checked printing,
   frame, border, or foil, and `PrintedCardRef` (the actual runtime card
   identity, `card.rs:89-92`) has no set-code field for any format. So
   `legal_sets` membership isn't an old-school-specific approximation
   needing a gate or a caveat — it's this engine's one existing legality
   model, applied identically to a new format the same way it's already
   applied to every format that shipped before this proposal. The
   registration gate for Old School 93-94/95 reverts to §8's pre-round-10
   state (mana burn only). The round-10 `ArtChainEntry` display fix is
   retracted from this proposal (a real idea, but belongs in its own
   proposal, not used to paper over a legality question that no longer
   needs it). Genuine per-card printing selection (briefly surveyed, not
   designed: the deck-builder already has `PrintingPickerModal.tsx` and a
   `DeckEntry.sourcePrinting` field that's currently discarded before
   reaching the engine, `client/src/services/deckParser.ts:5-9,45-73`) is
   confirmed as a real, moderate-lift, but separate future feature, general
   to every format — also not designed here. See PLAN.md §1's "RESOLVED —
   round 11" note for the full argument and §6 for the test this adds.

## Open (needs a human decision — do NOT resolve unilaterally)

1. ~~**Delivery surface**~~ — **RESOLVED**, see "Maintainer input" section
   above: (c), entered via Axis A (structural config) through the existing
   lobby first, Axis B (legality/legacy-rules) as audited presets validating
   the same schema. PLAN.md §1 and §7 updated accordingly.
2. ~~**Reprint-policy fidelity**~~ — **RESOLVED, round 11** (round 10's
   attempt to resolve this via a display fix was directly rejected by
   round 11's review — a cosmetic default isn't a legality resolution; see
   round 10/11 log entries above for the full back-and-forth). **Final
   resolution: `legal_sets` membership is not an approximation of Old
   School 93-94/95's legality — it's the exact same oracle-card-level
   legality model every format in this engine already uses.** Confirmed
   directly: `GameFormat::Premodern`'s legality check
   (`LegalityFormat::Premodern`, `crates/engine/src/types/format.rs:243`)
   and every other built-in format's are ALL oracle-card-level only; no
   format anywhere in this engine has ever checked printing, frame, or
   foil, and the runtime card identity (`PrintedCardRef`, `card.rs:89-92`)
   has no set-code field for any of them. There is no inconsistency to gate
   Old School 93-94/95 against, because no format in this engine does more
   than what `legal_sets` already gives them. Registration reverts to §8's
   original gate (mana burn only, no new blocking axis). Two real ideas
   surfaced along the way are explicitly deferred as separate, future,
   general (not old-school-specific) proposals, not designed further here:
   (a) a legal-set-aware `ArtChainEntry` display default (round 10's fix,
   retracted from THIS proposal but not abandoned as an idea), and (b)
   genuine per-card printing selection in the deck builder — briefly
   surveyed, confirmed as a moderate plumbing lift reusing existing
   components (`PrintingPickerModal.tsx`, `DeckEntry.sourcePrinting`), not
   a from-scratch feature, but out of scope here. See PLAN.md §1's
   "RESOLVED — round 11" note for the full argument. The original framing
   below ("no frame/art metadata per printing, full stop") was too
   pessimistic and is kept for its still-accurate research, not as a live
   open question:
   - **Engine/MTGJSON side** (`CardDatabase::printings_for`,
     `crates/engine/src/database/card_db.rs:227`): a bare `Vec<String>` of set
     codes, sourced from MTGJSON `AtomicCards.json`
     (`crates/engine/src/database/mtgjson.rs:78`). This format is
     structurally oracle-level, not printing-level — frame/border/full-art
     data **cannot** exist here; this is a schema-level absence, not a
     dropped-field ingestion gap. Confirmed empirically: `printings_for()`'s
     order is alphabetical-by-set-code (e.g. `10E` before `AKH`), not
     chronological — "pick the oldest legal printing" cannot use this order
     as-is.
   - **Frontend/Scryfall side** (`client/src/services/scryfall.ts`,
     `scryfall-printings.json` generated by
     `scripts/gen-scryfall-printings.sh`): a fully-built, **already-working**
     printing system with real per-printing `released_at`, `border_color`,
     `frame_effects`, `full_art`, `collector_number` — sourced from Scryfall's
     bulk data, not MTGJSON. `pickOldestPrinting()`
     (`client/src/services/scryfall.ts:136`) already implements "pick the
     oldest printing" as working code, and `preferencesStore.ts`'s
     `ArtChainEntry` (a typed union: `{type:"oldest"}` /
     `{type:"prefer_borderless"}` / etc., with a real v5→v6 migration
     upgrading a flat enum into this richer chain type) is a per-player
     cosmetic preference for exactly this.
   - **These two systems are completely disconnected** — they only share an
     oracle-id join key. The frontend's printing/frame system has no
     awareness of format legality; the engine's legality system has no
     printing/frame data. **The actual gap is not "no frame data exists,"
     it's "the frame data that exists has never been cross-referenced against
     format/legal-set data."**
   - Confirmed no per-user printing choice flows through the engine at all
     today: `printings_for()` has zero WASM/frontend call sites
     (`grep -rn "printings_for" crates/` → only an offline coverage tool and
     a test). `GameObject`/`PrintedCardRef`
     (`crates/engine/src/types/card.rs:76`) carries oracle_id + face_name
     only, never a set code.
   - Release-date data for a set-code→date join **already exists**
     (`SetCatalog`/`SetMeta.release_date`,
     `crates/engine/src/database/set_catalog.rs:78`, loaded from MTGJSON's
     `SetList.json`) and is even already projected to the frontend for an
     unrelated purpose (`client/public/set-list.json`, deck-builder set
     filter). So an "oldest legal printing" ordering is a **wiring problem**,
     not a new-data-acquisition problem — cheaper than true frame-level
     enforcement.
   - **Decided, round 11 (supersedes round 10's framing on this line):**
     `legal_sets` membership is not an approximation at all — it's the
     identical oracle-card-level legality model `Premodern` and every other
     format in this engine already uses (`LegalityFormat::Premodern`,
     `format.rs:243`; no format anywhere checks printing/frame/foil). No
     further engine work is gated on or expected for this dimension. The
     display fix and real printing-selection ideas above are both real and
     worth pursuing, but as their own separate, general proposals — not as
     part of resolving this item. See PLAN.md §1's "RESOLVED — round 11"
     note. This is no longer an open product decision.
   - **Correction — round 12: it WAS still an open product decision, and
     round 11's premise didn't survive the maintainer's follow-up review of
     this exact resolution.** The maintainer correctly rejected "no format
     checks printing/frame/foil" as sufficient justification here: Premodern
     never claimed a printing-level requirement in the first place, so it
     stopping at set-code membership isn't an approximation of anything.
     Old School 93-94/95's own cited source (RESEARCH.md §1) explicitly DOES
     require non-foil original-frame/art reprints — `legal_sets` genuinely
     falls short of that specific stated rule, regardless of what every
     other format does or doesn't check.
   - **Final resolution, round 12 (a real product decision, made
     deliberately rather than resolved away by precedent):** decline to
     build engine-owned printing/frame enforcement — confirmed above that
     the engine's and frontend's printing systems are disconnected and
     wiring them is a genuine, moderate-lift, general future feature, not
     an old-school-specific one. Instead, accept the set-code-only
     approximation on the grounds that it's genuinely acceptable for THIS
     engine, not merely convenient: in a digital-only client, a printing's
     frame/border/foil status has zero gameplay consequence — two printings
     with identical Oracle text are identical for every rules purpose the
     engine cares about. The paper community's frame/art requirement serves
     an anti-counterfeiting/provenance function specific to a physical
     table, which has no digital equivalent. Declining to model that purely
     cosmetic, paper-specific concern is a legitimate scope decision — but
     presenting the approximation as full fidelity would not be, which is
     why this is disclosed structurally rather than left as a rejected
     framing repeated with different words: `CustomFormatDef` gains a
     `printing_fidelity: PrintingFidelity` field (new enum:
     `NotApplicable` / `SetCodeApproximation`), required and paired with
     `reprint_policy` at construction time (enforced by a registry gate and
     a test, not a doc comment — see PLAN.md §1's "round 12" note near the
     `CustomFormatDef` struct, §6's new test, and §7's second gate). Every
     preset with `reprint_policy: Some(_)` — the four EC formats — must set
     `printing_fidelity: SetCodeApproximation` and disclose the limitation
     in its player-facing `description`. This is the maintainer's own
     second offered resolution ("explicitly scope the presets as an
     oracle-card/set-code approximation"), made structural rather than
     documentary, and it is now genuinely closed — not by analogy to what
     other formats don't check, but by disclosing what this format's own
     stricter rule isn't getting.
3. **Classic Magic B&R cadence.** EC updates Classic's banlist twice yearly
   (Jan 1 / Jul 1). Bundled-preset data is version-controlled, so updates are
   ordinary edits — but whether we want a dated/versioned banlist history is
   open.
4. **Draw/tiebreaker resolution mechanics** (generalizing the Chaos Orb
   tiebreaker and the foreign-card-identification convention above): both are
   instances of a "how does this table resolve an otherwise-undecided
   outcome" hook, not an in-game rule. Confirmed via grep (`crates/draft-core`,
   `server-core`) that phase.rs has **no match-level concept at all today** —
   no best-of-N, no tournament round, no draw/tiebreak state machine; the
   engine models single games only. So this genuinely has two different
   shapes depending on a product decision this doc should not make
   unilaterally: (a) a **tournament-level policy** ("draws are not permitted;
   play resolves until decided," which needs no new state, since it's just a
   procedural rule about what happens after a game/match ends) or (b) a
   **per-format-configurable "how to decide a draw" hook**, which would
   require inventing a match/round concept above the single-game engine
   first — a materially larger scope than this custom-format engine. Given
   no match-level structure exists, this is flagged as **out of scope for
   the custom-format engine itself** and, if ever pursued, belongs to a
   separate, later "tournament/match structure" design, not bundled into
   `CustomFormatDef`/`LegacyRuleSet` here.
5. ~~**Ante-card handling**~~ — **RESOLVED, Phase 1d** (neither of the two
   options originally offered below; both were list-shaped, and the rule
   isn't). The framing was "a *third* list-shaped rule, distinct from banned
   (illegal outright) and restricted (legal, max 1)" — but **CR 407.3 does not
   define the ante cards as a list**: it defines them as the cards bearing the
   text "Remove this card from your deck before playing if you're not playing
   for ante", and then says "when not playing for ante, players can't include
   these cards in their decks or sideboards". The class is the printed text,
   and the prohibition is already exactly `banned`'s deck-construction
   semantics. So no new list, and no `banned` entries either.

   **Resolution: `AntePolicy` (`Excluded` | `Enabled`) as a fifth
   `LegacyRuleSet` axis, enforced by a class predicate, not a roster.**
   - `Excluded` is the default, so every custom format — including every
     Axis-A lobby save — gets CR 407.3 enforcement for free, and
     `swedish_old_school()` needs no ante data of its own.
   - Enforcement reuses the predicate `deck_validation.rs` already had:
     `tiny_leaders_category_banned`'s `"playing for ante"` test, extracted as
     `face_uses_ante` so both callers share one definition of the class.
     Verified exact — Scryfall's `oracle:"playing for ante"` returns exactly
     9 cards (Amulet of Quoz, Bronze Tablet, Contract from Below, Darkpact,
     Demonic Attorney, Jeweled Bird, Rebirth, Tempest Efreet, Timmerian
     Fiends), the whole class with no false positives. A 7-name list would
     have been a snapshot of only the subset inside one format's set window.
   - `DeclaredPool::status` checks it ahead of banned/restricted, because a
     format may also RESTRICT an ante card — Swedish restricts three of the
     seven it carves out — and one legal copy is still one copy too many.
   - The rejected "`ante_enabled` toggle" half is answered by the axis'
     `Enabled` variant, which is **gated** by `IMPLEMENTED_LEGACY_AXES` like
     any other declared-but-unbuilt axis: it would promise the CR 407.2 ante
     zone and CR 407.4 ante action, which no engine code provides. Note the
     asymmetry — only `Enabled` is a declared axis; `Excluded` is enforced
     today and so is never gated, or every custom format in existence would
     be rejected.
   - Why `LegacyRuleSet` and not `LegalityRules`: CR 407.1 calls ante a rule
     from "earlier versions of the Magic rules", now "an optional variation on
     the game" and "strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering
     Tournament Rules" — the same shape as mana burn. It also gets the
     existing gate at both call sites (`custom_format_pool` and
     `FormatConfig::deserialize`) for free rather than needing a parallel one.

   Original framing, kept for its research, not as a live open question: "Must
   be removed before play unless the tournament is specifically played for
   ante" is a third list-shaped rule; the schema has no slot for it today.
   Needs a decision: a third named list on `LegalityRules`, or folding it into
   `banned` gated by a new `ante_enabled: bool`/toggle. Low urgency (only 7
   cards; ante itself has no in-engine support and none is proposed here), but
   should not be silently dropped when the preset ships.
6. **Swedish Old School's reprint policy is unconfirmed.** Only "English
   versions are allowed" is stated by the primary source
   (`oldschool-mtg.blogspot.com/p/banrestriction.html`); a secondary source's
   "no Revised-or-later reprints" claim was not independently verified this
   session. Do not encode `ReprintPolicy::OriginalPrintingsOnly` for this
   preset without re-confirming against the primary source or the community
   directly.

- **Authoritative EC ruleset**, re-verified this session (2026-07-07) against
  `https://github.com/northern-information/lordsofthepit.com/blob/main/src/pages/formats.md`
  (raw fetched). Full verbatim card lists captured in RESEARCH.md §1.
- **Prior art**: `GameFormat::Limited` planning cycle, phase 53. Retrieved via

  Summarized in RESEARCH.md §7 (Analogous Trace).
- **Swedish Old School 93/94 ruleset**, fetched this session (2026-07-15) from
  `http://oldschool-mtg.blogspot.com/p/banrestriction.html` — the primary
  source for legal sets, the empty banned list, the 25-card restricted list,
  the ante-card carve-out, and the (absent) legacy-rules mentions used above.

## Relationship to adjacent work — scope boundaries (do NOT accommodate here)

- **Vanguard (CR 902) is orthogonal to this design — do not entangle them.**
  GitHub issue phase-rs/phase#5056 ("Implement the Vanguard variant (CR 902)")
  requests Vanguard support; verified **still OPEN and unaddressed**
  (`gh issue view 5056 --json state` → `"OPEN"`, 2026-07-07). Vanguard is
  genuinely unimplemented (no `CoreType::Vanguard`, no `GameFormat::Vanguard`, no
  Vanguard cards in `card-data.json`). Per the issue's own analysis, phase.rs
  already implements **three of the four** CR "nontraditional card lives in the
  command zone" casual variants — Planechase (CR 901, `game/planechase.rs`),
  Commander (CR 903, `game/commander.rs`), Archenemy (CR 904, `game/archenemy.rs`)
  — and Vanguard (CR 902) is "structurally the simplest of the four… a per-player,
  game-long static modifier plus a command-zone ability source, which is a strict
  subset of what archenemy.rs/planechase.rs already do." **Vanguard therefore
  belongs to the existing command-zone-supplemental-card family, NOT to the
  `CustomFormatDef`/`LegacyRuleSet` mechanism designed here.** The two are
  independent: this custom-format engine neither depends on nor blocks Vanguard,
  and this design does **not** need to accommodate it. Flagged so a reader does
  not mistakenly try to fold Vanguard into the custom-format layer.

- **Duplicate-check pass against all open upstream issues/branches (2026-07-07,
  before taking this to the maintainer).** Searched `phase-rs/phase` open
  issues/PRs and all `origin` branch names for: format, old school, block
  constructed, legendary rule, mana burn, damage stack, wish, vanguard, audio,
  video, voice chat, webrtc, spectator, watch game, replay, commentary,
  microphone/camera. Findings:
  - **No duplicate or conflicting open issue/PR/branch exists for this
    custom-format-engine design, the audio/video-chat design (phase 59), or
    the watch-game-mode design (phase 60).** Clear to proceed to the
    maintainer conversation on all three without a collision risk.
  - **phase-rs/phase#5056 (Vanguard)** — already covered above, confirmed
    still open, confirmed orthogonal.
  - **phase-rs/phase#5169 ("New Format Plan: Dandan"), OPEN, created
    2026-07-06 (one day before this check) — worth reading before the
    maintainer conversation, not a duplicate.** An unclaimed (no linked PR,
    no "token" claimed in comments), extremely detailed community-authored
    engine-planner-style implementation plan for a NEW `GameFormat::Dandan`
    shared-library format (both players draw from one shared 80-card library
    + graveyard; a real Wizards Secret Lair promo format). This is a
    **different actual format** from anything in this design (not an EC
    retro format, no legal-sets/banlist/legacy-rules axis) — but it is the
    **same class of upstream activity**: another contributor extending
    `GameFormat`/`FormatConfig` right now. Two things worth surfacing to the
    maintainer alongside this design:
    1. It's live precedent for how the maintainer currently accepts new
       formats: **one bespoke `GameFormat` enum variant + `FormatConfig`
       constructor per format**, not a generic data-driven mechanism. That's
       a legitimate approach for a format needing genuinely new engine
       *behavior* (Dandan needs new shared-zone/deal-order/ownership
       machinery no config toggle could express) — and is exactly why this
       design proposes `GameFormat::Custom` only for the *configuration*
       axis (legal sets, banned/restricted lists, era-rule toggles), not as
       a replacement for bespoke variants when a format needs new behavior.
       **Dandan's own plan already argues for `SharedZones` as a reusable
       building block** ("future shared-deck formats reuse the same
       `SharedZones` descriptor"), and that generality is not hypothetical:
       verified via WebSearch (`eternalcentral.com/type4`, plus a Riptide Lab
       forum thread grouping "Cubelets, Dandân, and other shared deck
       formats" together) that **Type 4** — a real, decades-old casual
       format (unlimited mana, no lands, one spell/turn, chaos targeting,
       last-player-standing) — has a documented variant where "all players
       use the Type 4 card pool as a shared library," structurally the same
       zone-sharing shape as Dandan. Type 4's *other* rules (infinite mana,
       no lands) are unrelated to this design and out of scope, but it's a
       second real, named format that would want the exact `SharedZones`/
       `library_of`/`graveyard_of` building block Dandan's plan proposes —
       reinforcing that it's worth building generally rather than
       Dandan-specifically, consistent with "build for the class."
       Worth confirming the maintainer sees these as complementary, not
       competing, approaches.
    2. No technical overlap or conflict either way: Dandan's shared-zone
       accessors and interleaved dealer touch `types/game_state.rs`/
       `mulligan.rs`/`zones.rs`; this design's touch points
       (`types/format.rs`, `game/deck_validation.rs`, a new
       `evaluate_custom_format`) are additive to the same `GameFormat` enum
       but do not share implementation surface.
  - **phase-rs/phase#4613 ("Add action-based game replay system"), OPEN,
    created 2026-06-29 — related-but-distinct from phase 60 (watch-game
    mode), not a duplicate.** Requests deterministic post-hoc replay
    export/scrub (record a finished/in-progress local game, load it later,
    step through in a read-only viewer) — a different use case from phase
    60's live spectating (phase 60 found spectator mode already fully
    implemented and live). Both land on a similar "read-only board view" UI
    surface, so worth a one-line cross-reference in phase 60's docs, but
    they solve different problems and neither blocks the other.
  - No open issue or branch name relates to audio/video/voice/webrtc chat,
    or to spectator/watch-game mode as a feature request (consistent with
    phase 60's finding that spectator mode already shipped without a
    tracking issue ever being filed for it).

## Additional validation example — Classic Legacy / "Lost Legacy" (community, non-EC)

A fifth real-world community format, independent of Eternal Central, that
further validates the schema's generality. Two distinct sources, both
user-provided this session — kept separate since they describe two different
things under overlapping branding:

- **Classic Legacy** (`https://classiclegacymtg.com/`, fetched 2026-07-07):
  Alpha through Rise of the Eldrazi (2010). **No restricted list at all** — a
  57-card banned list only (all five Moxes, Black Lotus, Ancestral Recall,
  Demonic Tutor, Yawgmoth's Will, Tinker, etc. are fully **banned**, not
  restricted-to-1 the way EC's 93-94 treats them). Explicitly states three
  rules deltas from current Comprehensive Rules: "The London Mulligan is
  used" (i.e. explicitly the *modern* default, not an old-style mulligan),
  "There is NO mana burn," and "Combat damage does not use the stack."
  **This is structurally the inverse of EC's Middle School/Classic Magic**:
  an old, broad card pool paired with entirely *modern* choices on every
  `LegacyRuleSet` axis. That is a stronger decoupling proof than Block
  Constructed (§ above) — it shows card-pool era and legacy-rules flags are
  not just independently *toggleable in principle*, a real, currently-run
  community format actually uses that independence (old pool + modern
  rules), not only the "old pool + old rules" combination the four EC
  presets happen to use. No new `LegacyRuleSet` field is needed to support
  it — it is fully expressible by *not* setting any of the flags already
  designed, on a broader `legal_sets` list.
- **"Lost Legacy 606"** (a dated tab titled "Lost Legacy" / ref. `606`,
  user-pasted content from a linked Google Sheet at
  `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/.../1rf9U9k93_.../htmlview#gid=0` — the sheet
  itself is a JS-rendered app and was **not** independently fetchable;
  content below is transcribed as pasted by the user, not independently
  re-verified against the live sheet). Labelled "(Legacy June 2006 - Pre
  Coldsnap)", sets "Alpha - Dissension/9th Ed., + Portals and Starter" — a
  **dated historical snapshot** of what tournament Legacy looked like at a
  specific point in time, distinct from the single fixed "Classic Legacy"
  ruleset above. This suggests the source project maintains *multiple*
  dated snapshots (naming pattern implies `606` = "2006, month 06"), which
  is an interesting further validation of "format as data" (a snapshot is
  just another `CustomFormatDef` instance with its own `legal_sets` cutoff
  and its own banned list) — **noted as a potential future direction, not
  investigated further and not in scope for the four-EC-preset MVP.**

  Rules deltas listed for this specific snapshot, and how each maps to what
  is already designed (or explicitly does not):
  - "Wishes can retrieve exiled cards" — **independently confirms**
    RESEARCH.md §9's pre-M10 Wish finding via a second, unrelated source.
  - "Mana Burn is in effect" + "Mana empties at end of phase" — **confirms**
    the mana-burn hook point already identified (RESEARCH.md §5): the
    "empties at end of phase" phrasing matches the engine's actual
    step/phase-boundary pool-emptying mechanism almost exactly.
  - "Damage uses the stack" — same as EC Middle School/Classic Magic,
    already modeled.
  - **"Same Legends are buried on resolution"** — this is the legend rule,
    described using **pre-2004 templating** ("bury" was a distinct keyword
    action for "destroy, cannot be regenerated" before being folded into
    plain "destroy" templating around 2004). The phrase "on resolution" is
    a potentially significant additional data point for RESEARCH.md §10's
    `LegendRuleScope::PreM14AnyController`: it may indicate the *original*
    legend rule was not a continuously-checked state-based action the way
    both the modern rule and the currently-designed `PreM14AnyController`
    variant are, but instead resolved as an immediate effect at the moment
    a legendary permanent entered (or a spell/ability finished resolving).
    **This needs a follow-up rules-history check before being treated as
    confirmed** — flagged here rather than silently folded into §10's
    existing SMALL-effort estimate, since a genuinely different resolution
    *timing* (immediate effect vs. SBA) could change that estimate.
  - **"CMC of split card in hand is X or X not the total"** — a real
    historical difference in how split cards' mana value was calculated
    outside the stack, but the precise mechanic and the years it applied
    are **not verified this session** (nothing in RESEARCH.md addresses
    this). Recorded as an **open flag candidate, not yet designed** —
    do not add a `LegacyRuleSet` field for this without first verifying the
    actual historical rule via an authoritative source, per this project's
    "verify before annotating" discipline.
  - **"Draws determined by foreign card identification"** — resolved via
    direct user explanation (not independently re-verified against an
    external source, per this doc's provenance discipline): each player
    shows their opponent an obscure card printed in a non-English language;
    the cards are shown back and forth, and the first player to fail to
    correctly identify/name the shown card loses. This reads as a
    paper-tournament social/anti-counterfeiting convention — a
    knowledge-based substitute for a coin flip or the Chaos Orb tiebreaker
    (see the EC "tied match" ruling above), not an in-game rule. It has no
    engine-relevant behavior: phase.rs already needs its own standard
    mechanism for resolving "who plays first" / breaking ties, and this is
    simply how humans did that at the table in an old-school paper-Magic
    setting. **No `LegacyRuleSet` flag needed for this.**
  - "Current Oracle on all cards" and "Reprints OK" — policy statements
    about which printing/wording to use, not engine-modelable rules deltas;
    same category as the already-noted reprint-fidelity open question
    (Open item 2, above).
  - "Proxies must be identifiable at arms length" — physical-tournament
    logistics with zero gameplay/engine relevance. **Explicitly out of
    engine scope**, noted only so a future reader does not wonder why it
    was dropped.

## Stretch goal (explicitly lower priority — do not design in depth)

- **Eternal Chaos** (a Lords-of-the-Pit variant on top of 93-94, NOT an
  EC-defined format): in-match booster-pack tutoring, a dynamically-built
  sideboard from opened packs, and a pre-match "Gentleman's Agreement" banlist.
  Depends on 93-94 already existing **plus** a genuinely new in-match
  pack-opening mechanic. Sequenced last; see PLAN.md §8.
  **Confirmed via WebSearch:** this in-match pack-opening mechanic is,
  structurally, exactly what the real card **Booster Tutor** (Unhinged;
  Oracle: "Open a sealed Magic booster pack, reveal the cards, and put one
  of them into your hand.") needs — open-a-pack, reveal, pick-one-to-hand.
  Whichever gets built first (the card's effect handler, generically, vs.
  the Eternal Chaos mechanic) is the reusable building block for the other;
  they should not be designed or implemented twice. Note the card's own
  effect is narrower (put one card into hand, not "build a sideboard from
  everything opened") — Eternal Chaos's dynamic-sideboard-from-packs piece
  is an additional layer on top of the same open-a-pack primitive, not a
  1:1 match.
