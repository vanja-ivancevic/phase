# Engine Implementer (Orchestrator)

This is the orchestrator for the phase.rs implementation pipeline. It runs as a **skill in the main thread** so it can spawn a fresh agent for every step that benefits from fresh context (planning, plan review, implementation, implementation review). Do not turn this into an agent — agents cannot spawn sub-agents, which is what made earlier versions silently degrade.

## Roles

| Step | Where it runs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Produce plan | **Fresh agent** invoking `engine-planner` | The plan is shaped by the task, not by the conversation history that led here |
| 2. Review plan | **Fresh agent** invoking `review-engine-plan` | Honest architectural review, independent of the planner |
| 3. Implement | **Fresh agent** following [executor.md](executor.md) | Surgical edits and preparatory checks; never commits |
| 4. Checkpoint + measure | This thread, then a fresh executor in measurement-only mode | The orchestrator creates the candidate commit; an isolated executor measures that immutable candidate |
| 5. Complete verification | This thread | Verify the committed candidate, never an in-flight working tree |
| 6. Review implementation | **Fresh agent** invoking `review-engine-impl` | Independent review of the immutable base-to-candidate diff |
| 7. Final acceptance | This thread | Accept only the exact reviewed checkpoint candidate or its Step 6 comment-only correction commit |

**Spawning by runtime.** Skills are invoked as `/name` under Claude Code and `$name` under Codex; both read `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (`.agents/skills` and `.codex/skills` link there). Under Claude Code, spawn `general-purpose` agents for Steps 1, 2 and 6 and the `engine-implementation-executor` agent type for Steps 3 and 4, which loads `executor.md`. Under Codex, spawn a worker agent per step and tell it which skill or file to read first — for Steps 3 and 4, `.claude/skills/engine-implementer/executor.md`. A runtime that cannot spawn agents runs each step in a fresh session and hands every reviewer ONLY the artifact under review (the full plan, or the unified diff), the original task, `CLAUDE.md`, the relevant review skill, the attempt history below, and in chartered runs the charter, phase index and deferral allowlist — never the conversation that produced the artifact. Never degrade to reviewing your own work in the same context; that is the failure this skill exists to prevent. If even a fresh session is impossible, say so in the final report and in the PR body under "Validation Failures"; do not claim the review loop ran clean.

The orchestrator never authors content itself. Its only jobs are: spawn agents, route their output to the next step, apply the run limits, own the commit, and close each spawned agent once its output is consumed (under Claude Code, send a `shutdown_request` and wait for the `shutdown_response` ack). The structured report each agent returns is the authoritative step handoff; progress messages are additive.

## Run ownership and checkpoint identity

Before dispatching an executor, fix `BASE_SHA` and the in-scope paths for the run; in a chartered run each phase fixes its own `PHASE_BASE_SHA` at phase start. Every implementation or fix dispatch has a named `START_SHA` and `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKTREE` — the first round starts at `BASE_SHA`, a fix round at the prior reviewed `CANDIDATE_SHA`. Check `HEAD == START_SHA` and a clean tree before edits and again before the checkpoint, and stop if the diff has escaped the intended scope.

**Baseline reachability.** Before the first executor dispatch, check that the branch the work will land on can reach the base: `git merge-base --is-ancestor "$BASE_SHA" <landing target>` (the fetched PR target branch, or the local branch the work lands on). If it fails, list `git log --oneline <landing target>.."$BASE_SHA"`, and proceed only when those commits belong to this task or will land first; otherwise stop and report. Review verifies a plan against its base and never questions the base itself.

That is the whole provenance contract. **Do not build receipts, evidence records, manifests, digests, seals, ledgers, or any other artifact whose purpose is to prove to a later reader that these steps happened.** Git already records what changed and at which commit, and the reviewer reads the diff. Every step below is something you do and then act on, never something you notarize.

## Inputs

Either:

1. A task description (cards, CR rules, Oracle text patterns, affected subsystems, expected behavior), or
2. A pre-existing plan — treat as a draft unless it has already passed `review-engine-plan` to clean.

The invocation may also name a budget (see [Run limits](#run-limits)).

Before Step 3, prepare and verify a clean `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKTREE` at `START_SHA`. After its checkpoint, prepare clean detached base and candidate projection worktrees at `BASE_SHA` and `CANDIDATE_SHA`, and a distinct clean detached `COMPLETION_WORKTREE` at `CANDIDATE_SHA`; no projection or completion worktree is used for implementation. During an active pipeline session, do not re-ask about worktrees; use the session default.

Two build-economy rules govern measurement worktrees. **Build-once directories never pay for incremental state:** every measurement build — projection, completion, any target directory built once and never rebuilt — runs with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`. **Completion allocation is per run-segment, not per candidate:** one completion worktree and one isolated completion target directory per phase (per run when unphased), reset to each round's `CANDIDATE_SHA` — per-candidate allocation multiplies full cold builds for no isolation gain. Reuse is strictly sequential within the owning run; never share a reused directory with any concurrently running agent or lane. A reused completion directory still runs `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, since the disk cost is guaranteed and the warm-rebuild speedup is not. Re-measure if warm completion rebuilds start dominating wall clock.

**Sizing for pre-existing plans:** Step 1a needs a Sizing section however the plan arrived. A pre-existing plan lacking one — review-clean (which bypasses Step 1) or a draft — gets a **sizing addendum** from a fresh planner in `engine-planner` sizing-only mode, reviewed in `review-engine-plan` sizing-audit mode under the run limits, with the addendum and each round recorded in the phase-fit record. When Step 1a then fires on an already-clean plan, the charter-mode planner partitions rather than re-plans.

## Task scope and verification work

Keep the original requested behavior and acceptance criteria in every handoff. Before a verification action, name the claim it answers and look for an existing test, fixture, command or supported tool API. Regression tests, fixtures built with existing helpers, and small probes using existing infrastructure are ordinary task work.

**Verification machinery** is code or protocol that produces evidence about the candidate and is neither a committed product test run by the standard runners nor a documented command or supported tool API. Adding or repairing it needs an accepted [expansion case](#run-limits) naming the claim no existing test or command answers. Documented setup, waiting for a legitimate build, ordinary product tests and fixtures, and substituting an existing gate (Step 5's checks, an existing test) need none. A card fix never justifies a general-purpose browser driver, session manager, seeding service, cleanup protocol or framework unless the user asked for that product. Temporary, generated, untracked and outside-repository helpers are machinery too; exclusion from T2 is not permission to build them.

A test that reaches the product and reveals wrong behavior calls for a product fix. Required evidence stays required when tooling blocks it: never drop the check or claim a clean/ready result to escape a limit.

## Run limits

Apply these before every dispatch or verification-tool edit and after every result, across all modes, phases and renamed successor work for the original task.

**Attempt history.** Every planner, reviewer and executor receives the original task and acceptance criteria, current scope, the budget, and a brief attempt history: each review loop's rounds with their finding tags, and every expansion case with its outcome. Keep it in the [phase-fit record](#phase-fit-record); create no other ledger, schema or tracking script. If prior history is lost, report that and stop rather than reset it.

**Finding classes.** Reviewers tag every blocking finding — every plan-review blocker or material gap, and every HIGH or MED implementation-review finding (a LOW finding that reports no wrong behavior rides along with a design round or ships as a residual; any finding reporting wrong behavior is blocking):

- `behavior` — closing it changes product code or tests: a design choice, a missing site or path, a wrong or vacuous test, a false CR claim.
- `text` — it quotes a coordinate and supplies the replacement text (or the repair is deleting the sentence), and closing it changes nothing the code does.
- `machinery` — it concerns the artifact's own probes, censuses or verification protocol.

When in doubt, it is `behavior`.

**Design rounds and the loop limit.** A round with a `behavior` finding is a design round: fix it through a fresh planner (Step 2) or fix executor (Step 6), then review afresh. A round without one is closed as Steps 2 and 6 describe. Each return to Step 1 from an executor stop-and-return, and each abandoned or failed review dispatch, also counts as a design round of its loop; these rounds count toward the fifth-round limit only, and the lowering comparison skips them. Each review loop — the sizing audit, the charter, each plan loop, each implementation-review loop, the integration review, and the final PR review ([pr-handoff.md](pr-handoff.md)) — stops at its **fifth design round**, or sooner when **two consecutive design rounds** (counting design rounds only) **fail to lower the behavior-finding count**. A loop restarted, renamed or re-phased for the same work keeps its count, and returning from implementation to planning resumes that plan loop's count. Only accepting a candidate that implements part of the requested behavior resets the counts; a checkpoint, clean plan, helper-only phase or new reviewer does not. If tooling is itself the requested product, its accepted implementation qualifies.

**Budget.** The invocation may name `budget=tight|standard|until-clean`; the default is `standard`. The budget decides who approves spending past a limit — a design round past a loop limit, verification machinery, a `SCOPE_PATHS` extension outside the scope rule's standing classes, or a new phase or restart proposed at a stop:

- `tight` approves nothing and takes the decline path.
- `standard` asks the user with an expansion case, and takes the decline path when nobody can answer (an autonomous run).
- `until-clean` approves its own cases, and stops after two consecutive failed predictions, at a ceiling the user named, or, with no ceiling named, at a loop's tenth design round.

A budget or approval covers one original task. A generic "continue" approves nothing.

**Expansion case.** Before any such spend, record this in the phase-fit record and, when asking, pose it as the question:

1. **Open item** — the finding's ID, severity and tag, or the missing evidence, quoted.
2. **What the spend buys** — the next action and the check that closes the item.
3. **Cost** — dispatches and cold builds, as counts.
4. **If declined** — this item's decline-path outcome.
5. **Prediction** — the checkable result that shows the spend worked (for a review round, the next round's behavior-finding count as a number lower than the current one), graded at the next result, listed with this loop's earlier predictions and their outcomes.

Argue from the open item and the prediction record only. Work already spent is not a reason. Claim no severity or convergence the finding list does not show, and never offer to drop a required check.

**Decline path.** Preserve commits and working changes. Before implementation, a declined case stops the run unless every open finding is `text`, which the orchestrator applies before continuing. After implementation, these may ship as residuals, each listed under the PR's Validation Failures with its evidence and a follow-up: `text` findings, LOW findings that report no wrong behavior, and observations outside the acceptance criteria. A final review whose only findings are listed residuals then counts as clean. Any HIGH or MED finding tagged `behavior` or `machinery`, wrong behavior for the card class, a false CR claim, or missing required evidence stops with no PR.

**At a stop**, report the original goal, completed product work, open items, each loop's round tags and prediction record, and the smallest next action as an expansion case. When behavior findings stayed at or above their prior count across three or more of the layers types / parser / resolver / targeting / frontend / AI / tests, say so and propose a smaller scope or a decomposition ([chartered.md](chartered.md)). No new phase or charter continues the same work without an accepted case. Required checks and clean final review still govern acceptance, and stops take precedence over the decomposition and text-round routes below.

### Defective-reference route

A parity or preservation row takes its expected value from another reading: the prompted route, base, or a sibling route. When that reference is wrong for the card, the defect exists before this work. It can surface in the planner's Reference Readings, in plan review, in an executor stop-and-return, or in any implementation-review finding (codex and CodeRabbit included). The route is fixed, so it is **not a stop and needs no expansion case under any budget**. Shipping the dependent work on the defective reading would be wrong behavior for the card class, which the decline path already refuses. Asking the user would only offer a choice between stopping and this route.

1. **Record** the card, the reading derived from its Oracle text and the CR, the measured reference, and the affected rows in the phase-fit record.
2. **Fix the reference first**, as its own unit ahead of the dependent work.
   - It runs the full pipeline (plan, review, implement, review) under fresh loop counts, with tests red at base and its own PR on `origin/main`.
   - Cover the defect's class (every route that drops the same value), not only the row that exposed it.
   - In a chartered run, add it as a fix phase before the dependent phase ([chartered.md](chartered.md#the-charter)).
3. **Hold the dependent work.** Keep its worktree and uncommitted changes. Don't commit or ship it on the defective reading.
4. **Resume** once the fix lands: rebase the dependent work, re-measure the affected rows, and make them assert the derived reading.

If the fix-first unit itself sizes above one unit (Sizing T1), or the dependent work cannot be held, it is an ordinary stop with an expansion case.

## Phase-fit gate (Step 1a)

**Unit anchor:** one *unit* = one coherent mechanic/behavior implementable by a single skill-checklist pass (e.g. one `/add-engine-effect` traversal), regardless of how many lockstep layers that pass touches. A routine interactive effect wiring types/parser/resolver/frontend/AI is **one unit** — the gate must not trip on it.

**The gate fires only on T1 AND T2**, adjudicated against the plan's Sizing section (adjudication is measurement, so it is not authoring):

- **T1 — Unit count:** the plan contains ≥2 units.
- **T2 — Scope size:** expected scope-path count ≥13, counted mechanically with exclusion before grouping: test fixtures (regardless of authorship or commit status) and uncommitted/regenerated pipeline data are excluded outright; then, among remaining files, a committed generated artifact groups with its source via a checked-in generator (committed `.d.ts` with source), and same-basename translation mirrors group with the authored file (the `en` locale counts; its mirrors add nothing). Directory entries never count as one path — expand to expected changed files, then group.

A single-phase verdict proceeds through the pipeline below. Re-adjudicate every time a fresh planner returns a revised plan, and at scope-freeze against the materialized `SCOPE_PATHS` list. When the gate fires, read [chartered.md](chartered.md) and follow it for the rest of the run: each phase runs Steps 1–7 with its per-phase inputs, followed by run-level acceptance.

### Phase-fit record

`<git-common-dir>/engine-implementer-runs/<run-id>/phase-fit`, append-only and numbered, carrying phase indexes only, never a commit SHA. It gets one entry per adjudication (the Sizing values used, per-trigger results, the T2 groups, the verdict), per review round (its finding tags and counts, and for a round closed without a design change, the edits applied with their before/after text), per expansion case and its outcome, and per revision or correction (class, before/after text, and the evidence that authorized it). Keep it out of the plan text reviewers and executors read: recording a verdict there hands the next independent check a prior verdict. It is a working note, not a provenance record.

## Pipeline

### Step 1 — Produce the plan

Spawn a fresh agent and instruct it to invoke `engine-planner`. The agent returns a plan with every mandatory architectural section.

**Spawn inputs:** original task and attempt history; in-scope file/subsystem hints; any prior reviewer findings as constraints (none on first round); the requirement to emit the mandatory Sizing section. In chartered runs, per-phase planners run in phase-plan mode with the inputs [chartered.md](chartered.md) lists.

Do not author or edit the plan in this thread; applying `text` findings in Step 2 is the one exception. If the returned plan is missing sections or is superficial, send the same inputs plus an explicit "missing sections" note to a **fresh** planning agent — do not patch it yourself.

### Step 2 — Review the plan

Spawn a fresh agent and instruct it to invoke `review-engine-plan` against the full plan. Each review runs in a fresh context — never reuse the previous reviewer's.

**Reviewer spawn inputs:** the full plan; attempt history; the original task description; the phase-fit context declaration (all Step 2 reviews in this pipeline declare it, so the Sizing consistency check is blocking); in chartered runs, the phase-plan inputs [chartered.md](chartered.md) lists.

- **A design round** (any `behavior` finding): when the run limits allow, a fresh planner revises the plan with the findings as constraints, then a fresh reviewer reviews the whole revised plan.
- **A round without `behavior` findings closes the loop:** the orchestrator applies each `text` finding itself (below), closes each `machinery` finding by substituting an existing gate or through an expansion case, and the plan is clean. No review follows. Closing a `text` finding changes nothing the plan decides, and re-reviewing applied wording only mints more wording findings. A review follows a behavior change, never an edit to text.

**Applying a `text` finding** is applying adjudicated text, not authoring:

- **Two-sided verification:** before the edit, the quoted old string is present at the finding's named coordinate — a quote that is not there is a stale coordinate, not an applicable fix; after the edit, the text the replacement adds is present exactly once where the old string was, and the old string is absent — except when the replacement contains it, where the added text is the sole gate. Count occurrences per fragment, not matching lines.
- **State the sweep's boundary:** population, predicate, scan direction, and whether the matched line counts. Every enumeration defect is an unstated predicate.
- **Fix the neighbours the edit breaks.** A repair frequently contradicts a section that classified the old form; sweep by mechanism, not by coordinate.
- Record the edits in the phase-fit record, never in the plan text.

A `text` finding that turns out to need a decision is `behavior`: dispatch a planner.

**Small-change lane.** When the Sizing shows one unit, at most four counted scope paths, and no new enum variant, serialized surface, or `WaitingFor`/`GameAction` change, the first review can close the loop by itself: if no `behavior` finding changes a seam, layer or type, and each supplies a concrete fix, apply the `text` findings, pass the `behavior` findings to the executor as constraints with no planner revision or re-review, and give them to the Step 6 reviewer to confirm each is closed. Otherwise the normal loop applies. Record `small-change lane` and the round's tags in the phase-fit record so the lane's outcomes can be compared with the full loop's.

A clean plan, or one closed by the small-change lane, is required to proceed. Stop at the run limits, for a human design decision the planner cannot resolve, for missing external access, or for an environment blocker that makes review impossible.

### Step 3 — Dispatch implementation

Spawn a fresh executor (see **Spawning by runtime**).

**Spawn inputs:** mode `implementation/fix`; attempt history; the reviewed clean plan in full; `BASE_SHA`; named `START_SHA`; the in-bounds / out-of-bounds path list; named `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKTREE`; any prior reviewer findings (none on first round); in chartered runs additionally the charter, phase index, and deferral allowlist. First round: `START_SHA == BASE_SHA`. Fix round: `START_SHA` is the previously reviewed `CANDIDATE_SHA`, never a moving branch head.

The executor edits only its `SCOPE_PATHS` list and runs **preparatory** checks. Preparatory success is not completion evidence. Its discriminating-test, selected-authority, coverage-honesty, maintainer-simulation, and CR-annotation gates remain the authoritative gates; do not restate or replace them here. A site outside the list in one of the scope rule's standing classes ([chartered.md](chartered.md#per-phase-identity-and-the-substitution-rule): compiler-forced, shared registration, comment-only) is a stop-and-return: in a chartered run the scope rule answers it; in an unphased run the orchestrator adds the path, records its class evidence in the phase-fit record, re-dispatches the round, and gives that evidence to the Step 6 reviewer to confirm. Any other out-of-list site returns to Step 1. Every re-dispatch after the first counts as a design round of the implementation-review loop.

If the executor returns "stop and return" items (plan contradicts current code, ad hoc parser dispatch unavoidable, CR uncertain, machinery needed), do NOT improvise around them. Check the run limits and scope boundary first; machinery needs an expansion case. If further work is permitted, return to Step 1 with the executor's findings as constraints and re-run Steps 1–3 without resetting attempt history — in a chartered phase this resolves to the *phase's* plan step, never a fresh full-task Step 1.

### Step 4 — Checkpoint the candidate

The checkpoint is the candidate commit, and it is the orchestrator's to make — never the executor's. Stage each approved path by explicit pathspec: never `git add -A`, and never commit without a pathspec, because the shared index can sweep in another agent's staged files. Before staging, confirm no pre-existing change overlaps an approved path; if attribution is ambiguous, stop and return rather than unstage, sweep in, or overwrite another agent's work. Commit, then confirm `git -C "$IMPLEMENTATION_WORKTREE" rev-parse HEAD` equals the `CANDIDATE_SHA` you recorded, and that `START_SHA..CANDIDATE_SHA` contains only the intended paths. Never measure an uncommitted tree or use a moving `HEAD` as the candidate. Verify `HEAD` is attached before any push, never pipe `git push` into `tail`/`head`, and push only through Step 7's ship or when asked.

If the change touches the parser, find out whether it moves parser output: dispatch a fresh executor in measurement-only mode against the base and candidate projection worktrees, which builds the tooling on each side, generates card data from each against the same pinned data root, and diffs the two. Report what changed. `./scripts/gen-card-data.sh` and `cargo coverage` do not answer this question.

### Step 5 — Verify the committed candidate

Run the checks in a clean worktree at `CANDIDATE_SHA`, not in the implementation worktree — a check that passes against uncommitted edits has told you nothing about what you are shipping. Run every gate the changed surface calls for: formatting for any implementation change, the Rust/engine/parser block, `./scripts/check-interaction-bindings.sh --check`, `cargo coverage` with no card regressed and `cargo semantic-audit` with zero new findings for Rust paths, the frontend block for frontend paths, the parser gate for parser paths. Markdown-only policy changes need scope and diff checks; do not run Cargo or Tilt for them.

The full suite is owed at the tree being shipped. An intermediate fix round may narrow to the touched surface — say so plainly when reporting it, since a narrowed run is not a suite pass — and re-run unfiltered before acceptance.

### Step 6 — Review the immutable candidate

Spawn a fresh agent to invoke `review-engine-impl` against `BASE_SHA..CANDIDATE_SHA`, with the original task, reviewed plan, in-scope paths, prior findings (including any small-change-lane constraints) and attempt history. It reviews the diff and the checks that were run; additional checks must answer a concrete unresolved claim within the task scope. Missing evidence returns to the orchestrator, not an independent tooling project. After the result, apply the [run limits](#run-limits) before any fix or return to planning.

- **A design round** (any `behavior` finding): a fix executor starts from the reviewed `CANDIDATE_SHA` with the findings as constraints, then Steps 4–6 repeat.
- **A round without `behavior` findings closes the loop:** comment-only corrections (below) are applied by the orchestrator. Other `text` findings go to a fix executor, which applies the supplied text verbatim, followed by Steps 4–5, with no Step 6 re-review, because closing a `text` finding changes nothing the code does. `machinery` findings close as in Step 2.

**Comment-only corrections.** A finding is a comment-only correction when closing it adds or removes no non-comment line of a `.rs` file — a false, stale or missing sentence in a `//`, `///` or `//!` comment, a citation, a label — and the finding supplies the replacement text or the repair is deleting the false sentence. A correction in any other file kind goes to a fix executor. When every finding of a round is one, no implementation executor is dispatched and no review follows. The orchestrator applies each correction itself, inside the phase's `SCOPE_PATHS` (a correction whose file is outside the list goes to a fix executor), with Step 2's two-sided verification, commits once on the reviewed candidate, and records the class and the before/after text in the phase-fit record. The commit is proven comment-only by diffing the reviewed SHA (the head the review saw) against the correction commit's SHA, both named explicitly: `git diff --no-renames --name-only <reviewed SHA> <correction SHA>` lists only `.rs` paths in `SCOPE_PATHS`, `git diff --no-renames -U0 <reviewed SHA> <correction SHA>` has at least one hunk, and over its hunk lines (file headers excluded) every `^[+-]` line matches `^[+-][[:space:]]*//` and, read at its coordinate, lies outside a string literal, with a control showing the same predicate rejects a code line that carries a trailing `//` comment. The correction commit reruns Step 5 and, for parser paths, Step 4's parser measurement, in full, because AI-CONTRIBUTOR §6 reuses evidence from the same candidate and which comment lines an instrument reads is not predictable from the diff. Each correction gets one direct instrument check with its control leg for the claim the finding named — the census or grep that flagged the sentence no longer returns it, and did at the reviewed candidate. A correction whose proof, instrument check or reruns fail, a stale generated binding included (its regeneration is not comment text), is dropped: the implementation worktree returns to the reviewed SHA and the findings go to a fix executor. When in doubt, it is a fix-executor finding. A correction round mixed with other findings dispatches the fix executor and folds the corrections into it as constraints.

### Step 7 — Final acceptance

Accept when the plan is clean or closed by the small-change lane; the review returns no `behavior` finding and its `text` findings are applied as Step 6 says (comment-only corrections proven), or only residuals the run limits allow, listed; the completion checks pass at the candidate; and `rev-parse HEAD == CANDIDATE_SHA` — the correction commit when one exists. In a chartered run this is per-phase acceptance, with `PHASE_BASE_SHA` substituted; it emits no Final Report snapshot, ship, or PR handoff, which are run-level only.

After final acceptance of a run a maintainer invoked directly, ship it with `/ship-commits` as [pr-handoff.md](pr-handoff.md#ship-through-the-merge-queue) describes, unless the task says local-only. Otherwise, when the task includes opening a PR, follow [pr-handoff.md](pr-handoff.md).

## Final Report

Return after final acceptance:

1. Plan-review rounds with each round's finding tags, whether the small-change lane was used, and the final clean result.
2. What changed, grouped by subsystem and file.
3. Key architectural decisions.
4. `BASE_SHA`, accepted `CANDIDATE_SHA`, the materialized `SCOPE_PATHS` (extensions included), and run-artifact root.
5. The `START_SHA` each round began from, and what the parser measurement found when the change touched the parser.
6. Verification commands run and results, separated into preparatory and completion evidence.
7. Implementation-review rounds with each round's finding tags, reviewed SHA, any Step 6 correction commit with its phase-fit entry, and the final result (clean, corrections applied and proven, or listed residuals).
8. Checkpoint commit hash and staged file list.
9. Coverage impact for parser changes.
10. Deviations from the plan with reasons.
11. Self-flagged risks and judgment calls (yours + executor's).
12. Remaining items, if any, with reasons.
13. The budget, the phase-fit verdict and record path, every expansion case with its prediction and outcome, and abandoned candidates from approved restarts.
14. When shipped, the `/ship-commits` final report.
15. Chartered runs additionally: the items [chartered.md](chartered.md) lists.
