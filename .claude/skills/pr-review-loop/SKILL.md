# PR Review Loop

Continuously review open contributor PRs, reprocessing only when GitHub state indicates new information: changed head, author follow-up, stale approval, stale request-changes, CI transition, queue drop, or a policy/hard-stop condition.

This skill is intentionally small. Mutable policy and contributor-specific state do **not** live here.

## Sources Of Truth

- **GitHub is authoritative** for PR head, author, reviews, comments, labels, CI, and merge-queue state.
- **Repo policy** lives in `.agents/pr-review-policy.toml` and must contain only repo-level, non-personal rules: path classifiers, domain capabilities, labels, hard-stop path patterns, generated-file patterns, and default gates.
- **Local review memory** lives outside the repo by default under `~/.local/state/pr-review/<owner>__<repo>/` unless `PR_REVIEW_STATE_DIR` or `--state-dir` is set. This directory contains:
  - `review-events.jsonl` — the sole canonical store: an append-only local event log with locked, deduplicated, `fsync`'d appends.
  - `review-summary.json` — generated token-minimal summary derived from the log.
  - `review-dashboard.json` — generated dashboard snapshot. It is a derived cache, not review memory: it combines the current open-PR scan with a retained terminal-PR archive so closed-without-merge PRs remain visible after the 48-hour active window.
  - A stray `review-state.sqlite` from an older build is an orphaned leftover; it is no longer read or written, and is safe to ignore or delete manually.
- **Never Read `review-events.jsonl` directly.** It is unbounded and not token-shaped; all queries must go through the `pr_review.py` CLI (`scan`/`inspect`/`recommend`/`analytics`/`compact`). `review-summary.json` and the dashboard renderer's `review-dashboard.json` input are the only state files intended for direct reading.
- **No hardcoded names.** Contributor standings, frontend exceptions, reviewer identities, private overrides, and one-off maintainer policy belong in local/private state, never in this skill.
- **Contributor standing lives in `private-overrides.json`** under `contributor_standing` (`skip`/`probation`/`watch`/`trusted`, lowercase-matched logins). It sits in the gitignored state dir on the review host; other hosts see only derived standing. The narrative quality log is a historical appendix — the event log, via recorded `signals`, is the data authority for per-contributor patterns.
- **Gittensor PR-history enrichment is advisory.** `pr_review.py` fetches the public Gittensor PR feed by default and adds a `gittensor` block to packets when the author appears there. A high closed-PR count across other repos adds the generic `gittensor-closed-heavy` proof risk flag. Use it to increase caution and require concrete proof; do not cite it as a public accusation or reject a PR on that signal alone.

## Commands

Use the CLI from the repo root:

```bash
python3 scripts/pr_review.py dashboard-data --repo phase-rs/phase --config .agents/pr-review-policy.toml
python3 scripts/pr_review.py inspect <PR> --repo phase-rs/phase --mode full
python3 scripts/pr_review.py recommend <PR> --repo phase-rs/phase
python3 scripts/pr_review.py recommend <PR> --repo phase-rs/phase --emit-event
python3 scripts/pr_review.py record --event-json -
python3 scripts/pr_review.py observe <PR> --repo phase-rs/phase --summary "Looked at follow-up; no material action"
python3 scripts/pr_review.py compact
```

`dashboard-data` is mandatory for every scheduled sweep; do not substitute `scan`. It atomically writes both the JSON snapshot and an adjacent `review-dashboard.html` (or the path supplied with `--html-output`) under the configured state directory. Its final JSON line reports `output` and `html_output`. Before reporting a sweep complete, verify that both reported files exist and are non-empty. `pr_review_dashboard.py` remains available to re-render an existing JSON file manually.

`record` validates each event's `event_type` and (when present) `outcome` against a closed vocabulary and lowercases the outcome on write; an out-of-vocabulary event is rejected with exit 1 and the allowed values, and `--force` bypasses validation (flagging the event `"forced": true`). The preferred recording path is to add `--emit-event` to `inspect`/`recommend`, fill the returned `event_skeleton` (its prefilled timestamp gives idempotent retries), and pipe it back to `record --event-json -`.

**Canonical-state ownership:** run `record` only from the lead's repository checkout, which owns the configured canonical state directory. Review workers report their proposed event type, signals, summary, and current head to the lead; they must not record from a worktree or a private `.agents/pr-review-state` path. A local event is audit memory, never proof that GitHub received the disposition.

Import legacy state once:

```bash
python3 scripts/pr_review.py import \
  --tracker /Users/matt/dev/forge.rs-pr-tracker.tsv \
  --quality /Users/matt/dev/forge.rs-contributor-quality.md
python3 scripts/pr_review.py compact
```

## Sweep Protocol

At sweep start, read `.agents/pr-review/campaign-hotspots.toml` if present (lead-maintained, untracked, updated at campaign routing/ship events). It lists: migrated areas with the rule now in force and the REDIRECT pointer for authors; coverage-delta semantics (an honest coverage DECREASE — silent swallows converted to explicit `Effect::Unimplemented` — is acceptable and must never be "restored"; in CI only the `engine_regress` bucket, a card LOSING a previously-supported handler, is fatal); diff content outside the contributor's control (generated-file dirt, export nondeterminism, staleness caused by maintainer-side churn — strip/normalize/rebase these yourself, never request changes for them); and files owned by in-flight campaign units (a contributor PR racing those files → hold + surface to the maintainer). Hotspots inform routing and comment content; they are NOT an additional review gate — if a hotspot prohibition reaches review without CI redding it, that is a gate gap: file it, don't make the contributor absorb the miss.

1. Resolve the acting identity from GitHub. Do not review PRs authored by the acting login.
2. Run `dashboard-data` for every scheduled sweep, instead of `scan`. This is the required scan command: it writes the JSON triage packet and the adjacent static HTML page in one atomic flow. Capture its reported `output` / `html_output` paths and verify both files are non-empty before continuing. A sweep whose dashboard generation fails is incomplete: report it as held with the command error rather than silently continuing with `scan`. Use the snapshot's `action_counts` / `candidates_by_action` for routing; do not infer legacy bucket names. Treat the packet as triage, not a final approval gate. The page reloads itself every 60 seconds; no server or separate scheduler is needed. `last GitHub check` is the snapshot generation time, while `last recorded look` and `last material action` come from local events. A material outcome inherently counts as a look; do not append a duplicate `observation` for it. Do not append an `observation` merely because the scanner ran; record one only after an actual human/agent look that has no material outcome.

   **Public-disposition completion gate:** local events and a zero `review` count are necessary but insufficient. For every PR inspected or reviewed this sweep, live-check GitHub before declaring it processed. A substantive blocker must have a current-head formal `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review, unless an existing current-head requested-changes review already states the same unresolved finding. A non-substantive hold must have a current-head maintainer comment explaining the exact external condition and next step. An approval/enqueue must be live-verified as `APPROVED` plus the expected queue/auto-merge state. Do not let a local `blocked`/`held` event substitute for a visible maintainer response.

   **Explicit review-label override:** the label configured as `labels.approved_for_review` in `.agents/pr-review-policy.toml` is a maintainer instruction to review the PR. Read the name from policy rather than repeating it here: the sweep must list the same label `recommend_from_packet` recognises, or renaming it in policy silently stops labelled PRs from being forced into review. After generating the dashboard, live-list open PRs carrying it:

   ```bash
   LABEL=$(python3 -c "import tomllib,pathlib; print(tomllib.loads(pathlib.Path('.agents/pr-review-policy.toml').read_text())['labels']['approved_for_review'])")
   gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state open --label "$LABEL" \
     --json number,author,headRefOid
   ```

   For every listed PR not authored by the acting login, treat the label as the highest-priority **review-routing** override: it supersedes `defer-fe`, hard-stop routing, and every other advisory bucket, skip, standing, or default gate that would otherwise prevent a full maintainer review. Fetch `inspect --mode full` and run `review-impl` against the live head even when the dashboard classifies it as deferred or `request_changes`. Do not remove the label as part of review.

   The label grants review eligibility, not merge eligibility: it never bypasses a self-review exclusion, hard-stop safety handling, current-head evidence requirements, or the handler's approval/enqueue bar. A hard-stop finding discovered during the label-forced review still receives its normal visible blocker disposition. When recording that material disposition, set `review_routing_label` to the configured label name; the scanner uses that current-head marker to avoid repeatedly dispatching an unchanged labeled PR. Conversely, do not repeat a review solely because the label remains after a current-head formal disposition already addresses all findings; ordinary freshness triggers still govern re-review.
3. Every packet (and `recommend` output) carries an advisory `contributor` block — standing, scrutiny, `scrutiny_reasons`, `recurrence`, `first_contribution` — derived from the local event log plus `contributor_standing` overrides; it is `null` only when the PR has no author login. Scale review depth by it: `first_contribution` → full evidence bar, and point the author at the `docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md` gates in the first review comment; `elevated` → dig specifically into the recurring signals named in `scrutiny_reasons`; `maintainer_attention` → include the contributor in the sweep report for the maintainer. `light_touch_eligible` permits a lighter pass only while scrutiny is `normal`.

**Model declarations route review depth; they do not authorize an automatic close.** Frontier remains the requested contribution floor in `docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md`, but a non-Frontier declaration or trailer is an elevated-scrutiny signal, never a `decline` by itself. Do not close a PR merely because its stated model falls below that floor.

For a non-Frontier PR, require the full evidence bar: accurate model declaration, concrete `/engine-implementer` (or a specific `not-applicable`) method record, current-head Gate A and final `review-impl` evidence when applicable, relevant anchors, required verification, and a manual implementation review. A PR with that evidence must be reviewed on its merits. If the evidence is incomplete, request the missing proof or hold it; do not replace the review with a model-policy closure. An explicit maintainer message inviting continued review or asking the contributor to proceed also routes the current head to review, even if older prose describes a model-tier close.

A `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` trailer remains a scrutiny signal, not a closure reason. The behavioural CI-farming pattern — pushing unverified diagnostic commits or deleting passing assertions to obtain green CI — is review evidence on the current diff, not account-level or batch-close evidence. This maintainer-review rule intentionally overrides older automatic-close wording in `docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md` for this workflow.

Check both surfaces, and read what actually matched before acting — a bare `rg cursor` hits `WordCursor` and other identifiers:

```bash
gh pr view <PR> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq .body | rg -i '^\s*\**Model:'
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/commits --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.commit.author.name) <\(.commit.author.email)> :: \(.commit.message)"' \
  | rg -i 'cursoragent@cursor\.com|composer|haiku'
```

The tell that distinguishes a tool-user from a CI-farmer is behavioural, not a trailer: reverting a fix to push a diagnostic commit so CI prints a value, or deleting a passing assertion to turn a job green. Those earn the standing change; the trailer alone does not.
4. Every packet carries separate `artifacts`, `architecture_scope`, and `proof` blocks. The gates have independent modes. Artifact verification remains audit-only until its immutable post-publication cutoff is activated; while it is in audit mode, report `audit_would_decline` and continue the existing review flow unchanged. The repository architecture-scope policy is `review`: a triggered, unauthorized cross-surface PR requires a full maintainer implementation review and must never be auto-closed merely for lacking an `accepted` issue. This includes bounded class work that turns a parser/engine `Effect::Unimplemented` path into supported behavior even when it needs existing choice, frontend, or transport plumbing. Reserve `enforce` for an explicitly configured future policy; only then does an unauthorized trigger decline before diff review. Neither audit result authorizes a comment, close, dequeue, or other mutation. Claimed parse impact remains optional manual quality evidence. `proof.proof_gap` remains the independent risk-evidence gate.
5. For each candidate:
   - `hard_stop` / `request_changes` — surface the precise blocker; do not enqueue. If the blocker follows this sweep's implementation review and no equivalent current-head formal requested-changes review exists, delegate to `pr-contribution-handler` to post one before recording the terminal outcome.
   - `decline` — do not fetch or review the implementation diff. This route is valid only when the configured architecture mode is explicitly `enforce` (or another independently enforced gate applies). Live-recheck `state`, `headRefOid`, body, and auto-merge, rerun `recommend`, and proceed only if the same current head still returns `decline`. Put the packet's complete `decline_comment` in a temp file, post it with `gh pr comment <PR> --body-file <file>`, then run `gh pr close <PR>`, record a `decline` event with the structured evidence, and stop. If auto-merge is enabled, disable it before commenting/closing. Audit-only `audit_would_decline` is reporting data and authorizes no comment, close, dequeue, or mutation.
   - `skip` — disambiguate by `reason`: `closed` / `self_authored` need no action; `contributor_standing_skip` is an explicit maintainer standing override meaning **decline to review** — record the skip and move on without reviewing. It does **not** authorize closing the PR. Check `skip_standing_policy` in `private-overrides.json` for the current configured action before assuming otherwise. A standing entry may carry an `alias_of` list of the same person's other accounts; that linkage is informational and carries no penalty of its own. A skip-listed contributor touching hard-stop paths still surfaces as `request_changes` (safety outranks the skip).

**Closing is a judgement about a diff, never about an account.** Two rules bound it, and both exist because they were once violated:

- **Low-effort close (any author).** An obviously low-effort PR is closed immediately regardless of the author's standing — a long merge history earns no pass, and a poor one earns no presumption. Close only on evidence visible in the PR itself: no substantive change, mechanical churn, an assertion duplicating coverage that already exists on the same code path, a test whose premise is fabricated (a named-card regression citing Oracle text the card does not have), or an `Effect::Unimplemented` swallow dressed as a fix. Verify that evidence yourself before closing — re-read the cited file and check the claim against `card-data.json` or the CR text rather than trusting an earlier review's summary. A PR that is merely wrong, incomplete, or in need of another round is **not** low-effort; that is an ordinary changes-requested review.
- **Prove the policy was in force before enforcing it.** Before closing, declining, or acting against an account for a policy violation, `git log` the policy document and diff the version that was live at the PR's `createdAt` against the rule you are applying. A rule that postdates the work cannot be violated by it. This is not hypothetical: on 2026-07-24 five PRs were closed and two contributors banned over `claude-haiku-4-5` commit trailers, when `claude-haiku-4-5` was named in the accepted Standard row of the tier table live at the time and the Frontier-only rule landed hours *after* the newest affected PR was opened. Related: a `Co-Authored-By` trailer names the model that wrote a given commit, so read trailers against the commits carrying the implementation — a session that falls back mid-run leaves sub-floor trailers on a compliant change.

     A maintainer approval you posted yourself at a head that has not moved remains valid evidence. Do not discard it because the account later drew scrutiny; re-verify the head, then act on the approval. Behavioural concerns about *how* a change was produced are review findings on that change — raise them there, and do not let them become grounds for a batch action against unrelated PRs.
   - `blocked` — current head already has blocking maintainer feedback. Read the blocking feedback before deciding to wait. If GitHub has no current-head formal requested-changes review, do not infer one from a local event: re-review the current head and delegate a formal `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review through `pr-contribution-handler` when a substantive finding remains. If any part of the blocker is "the branch is stale / needs a rebase", first classify the cause per **Maintainer-Caused Staleness** below; when our own churn broke it, the rebase or port is ours to do regardless of size, and the maintainer-fixup cap in this route does not apply. A formal `CHANGES_REQUESTED` state is not by itself a reason to keep waiting: if later maintainer feedback on the same head says the blocker is resolved, no unresolved finding remains, or the PR is otherwise clean-but-stuck because the formal review state was not cleared, delegate the PR to `pr-contribution-handler` in authorized mode to live-check, approve, label, and enqueue. If the only remaining blockers are maintainer-fixup sized, delegate the PR to `pr-contribution-handler` in authorized mode instead of making the contributor do another round-trip. Maintainer-fixup sized means small, local, low-risk corrections that do not change the accepted design or require new product/rules judgment: replacing/removing an incorrect CR citation while preserving the already-reviewed logic, resolving a small merge conflict where the target logic already exists on one side, stripping accidental generated/noise hunks, fixing a single failing regression caused by main drift when the accepted design is unchanged, or threading an obviously missing renamed helper/import through the existing implementation. Do not use this path when there is any unresolved substantive behavior, architecture, proof-gap, test-discrimination, parse-diff, security, or hard-stop concern; keep the PR blocked until a new head or author follow-up. If the contributor remains inactive and the blockers are not maintainer-fixup sized, follow the requested-changes expiry actions below instead of leaving the PR blocked indefinitely.
   - `defer` — a defer is a visible, PR-specific maintainer routing outcome, never a silent bucket. Live-recheck the current head, then post the recommendation's complete `defer_comment` with `gh pr comment <PR> --body-file <file>` before recording the event. It must identify the exact head, changed path class, policy reason, and explicitly say that the PR was triaged but not implementation-reviewed or approved. Use the `<!-- pr-review-deferred -->` marker and do not duplicate an existing marker for the same head. If the recommendation does not provide `defer_comment`, treat the sweep as incomplete (`held`); do not record a bare defer. Record the deferral event with the comment URL/ID and `defer_evidence`, then do not approve, enqueue, or merge. If the recommendation carries `label_to_apply`, add that label to the PR for maintainer filtering before moving on. Label names must come from repo policy, not from this skill.
   - `hold_ci` — record a non-terminal hold only when the packet is incomplete or an external condition prevents review. CI being pending, unknown, or red is not itself a review/enqueue blocker; merge-when-ready will wait for required checks. When an implementation review was completed but CI is the only remaining condition, delegate a short current-head maintainer comment through `pr-contribution-handler` before recording the hold; state the pending check and that approval/enqueue will resume after it settles. **Every subsequent sweep must recheck each current-head CI hold.** A pending or unknown result remains `hold_ci`; once required CI is terminal (green or red), it must route as `recheck_ci_hold_for_handler`, never fall through to a generic `hold`. The handler live-checks the head and either approves/enqueues the clean green result or investigates the terminal-red result and records a concrete disposition.
   - `hold` with reason `insufficient_admission_data` — enforcement cannot prove whether the PR is legacy because `createdAt` is missing or malformed. This is a maintainer/data blocker: do not inspect the implementation diff, comment, close, dequeue, or otherwise mutate the PR. Report the evidence and wait for corrected source data.
   - `queued` — auto-merge is already enabled or the PR is already in the queue. Treat this as no action only while required checks are pending or green. If any required check is terminal red, the PR is not across the finish line: delegate to `pr-contribution-handler` in authorized mode to inspect the failing check, apply a maintainer-fixup-sized repair when appropriate, re-approve/re-enable auto-merge if a push disabled it, or report a real blocker. Do not leave approved-but-red PRs to sit merely because they were previously enqueued.
   - `dequeue_stale_for_handler` / `update_branch_for_handler` / `recheck_ci_hold_for_handler` / `approve_ready_for_handler` / `warn_stale_changes_for_handler` / `close_stale_changes_for_handler` — advisory only; delegate execution to `pr-contribution-handler` in authorized mode. `recheck_ci_hold_for_handler` is mandatory when a current-head CI hold reaches a terminal required-CI state; it is the completion gate that prevents a settled CI hold from becoming a silent generic hold. `update_branch_for_handler` fires on both `BEHIND` (auto-resolvable via `gh pr update-branch`) and `CONFLICTING` (a real conflict; `update-branch` 422s). Check `mergeStateStatus` first, and note that neither status detects semantic staleness — see **Maintainer-Caused Staleness**.
   - `review` — fetch an `inspect --mode full` packet, then run `review-impl` against the current head and GitHub API/local diff evidence. For engine/parser-surface PRs, the parse-diff sticky comment (`<!-- coverage-parse-diff -->`) is REQUIRED review evidence: fetch its full body and confront the card-level diff against the PR's claimed scope. The packet's `parse_diff` field carries presence/state/`updated_at`. If state is `baseline_pending` on a stale branch (the `review_parse_baseline_pending` reason), route to update-branch first only when the PR history does not already contain a maintainer merge-main commit for the same baseline-pending churn. Repeated maintainer merge commits are PR spam: if the current head is otherwise clean and authorized mode would enqueue it after green CI, delegate to `pr-contribution-handler` to approve/enqueue now; if it is not clean, hold or review without mutating the branch. If the comment is absent but engine source changed, treat it as missing evidence: check whether CI ran for the current head before reviewing. If the review finds only a couple small, local, low-risk fixes between the PR and mergeability, do those maintainer fixups through `pr-contribution-handler` instead of requesting another contributor round-trip; use the same maintainer-fixup boundary as the `blocked` route above. If the manual quality gate passes, tell the handler to apply the existing policy-configured `quality` label with the type label; do not invent a `quality_recommended` event.
6. After the public-disposition completion gate succeeds, the lead records every material outcome with `record` from the canonical checkout. Attach `signals` (closed vocabulary, validated at record time) to the outcome event for observations from THIS review only, never re-recorded history. The vocabulary has two halves: defect signals (feed score penalties, windowed recurrence, and scrutiny) and praise signals (`right-seam`, `scope-discipline`, `discriminating-runtime-test`, `parameterized-not-proliferated`, `evidence-backed-pushback` — feed a capped score credit only, never recurrence or scrutiny). Never invent tokens: an out-of-vocabulary signal is rejected at record time, and if a needed concept is missing the fix is a vocabulary addition in `pr_review.py`, not a `--force`. Regenerate summaries with `compact` when useful. The dashboard keeps an unmerged closure in its recent section for 48 hours, then moves it into its retained archive rather than deleting it; GitHub remains authoritative when a PR is reopened or later merged.

After any delegated approval/label/enqueue operation, independently run `gh pr view <PR> --json labels` and verify the expected type label and, when requested, `quality` label are actually present. Delegation success without the live labels is incomplete handling.

Use `wrong-or-stale-cr-annotation` for an incorrect, unrelated, or stale CR citation and `duplicated-domain-vocabulary` when a PR creates a second name/type/helper for an existing domain concept. If a recorded signal was factually wrong, append `review_correction` with `corrects_event_id` and only the mistaken signal subset; never compensate by adding praise.

## Dispatching Review Agents

When a sweep fans `review` candidates out to subagents, the charter must carry these or the reports do not arrive:

- **A subagent's final assistant text is NOT delivered to the lead.** Findings reach you only when the agent calls `SendMessage` addressed to the lead. State this verbatim in every charter: *"Your final text is not delivered — report by calling SendMessage. If you do not call it, your work is lost."* Without that line, agents routinely finish a full review and go idle holding it.
- **Workers report; the lead records.** A worker must never call `pr_review.py record` from its worktree or an agent-local state path. Include the proposed event fields in its `SendMessage`; the lead records them only after the corresponding GitHub-visible review, comment, approval, or enqueue has been live-verified.
- **Idle means resumable, not finished, and not dead.** An `idle_notification` with no report is the normal shape of an agent that is still working or has finished without sending. Do not respawn on silence, and do not conclude the agent failed.
- **Do not substitute for a slow agent.** Reviewing a PR yourself because its agent has not reported wastes the agent's work and produces a rushed review from a lead holding many PRs of context. Ping with an explicit "call SendMessage now" and wait. If you have already posted a substitute review when the agent's report lands, treat the report as a mandatory re-check of your own comment and post a correction for anything it overturns — do not quietly prefer your own version.
- **Require the head OID in every report**, and re-verify it against the live head before posting anything. A head that moved mid-review invalidates the findings; the contributor may have already fixed the blocker. This is the freshness invariant applied to review dispatch.
- **Require file:line for every claim, and independently verify the load-bearing ones before posting.** Agents produce confident, well-formatted, wrong findings. Verify at minimum: every CR citation, every claimed failing check, every "this is dead/unreachable" claim, and any finding you are about to call a blocker.
- **An agent that corrects the lead's briefing is doing its job.** Charter briefings carry the lead's own errors into the review. When an agent pushes back on a premise you supplied, verify its correction rather than defending the brief.

## Verifying the Review's Own Evidence

The evidence bar in this skill binds the reviewer exactly as it binds the contributor. A review comment is a published artifact with the maintainer's authority behind it; a wrong citation in it is worse than a wrong citation in a PR, because the contributor will act on it.

- **Grep-verify every CR number the review itself cites**, not only the ones the PR cites, and quote the rule text rather than paraphrasing it. Never cite from memory. This applies with full force to a CR number you are using to tell a contributor that *their* CR number is wrong.
- **Prefer the dedicated rule over an adjacent general one, and check repo convention first.** Before proposing a citation, grep the codebase for how this rule is already cited (`rg "CR 115\.3" crates/`). If the repo standardises a pairing at many sites, match it. Proposing a different-but-defensible rule than the twenty existing sites use creates exactly the drift the annotation rule exists to prevent.
- **Confirm the rule says what the claim needs.** A rule number that exists, in roughly the right section, is not verification — read it. Adjacent subrules in the same section routinely cover unrelated single cards (CR 612.5 is Exchange of Words; CR 612.6 is Volrath's Shapeshifter), and layer placement often lives in a different section entirely from the effect it orders (CR 613.1c, not CR 612.x).
- **When a correction is warranted, post it plainly to the same PR** and record a corrected event. State what was wrong and what is right, do not re-litigate, and make clear which parts of the earlier comment still stand so the contributor knows what to act on.

## Review Freshness

Approval freshness is attached to a head, not to a PR number. A post-approval force-push, same-head newer blocking maintainer activity, author follow-up after review, or queue drop must re-surface the PR. A terminal local event never overrides newer GitHub activity.

The CLI models freshness using:

- current `headRefOid`;
- latest maintainer comment/review and the commit SHA attached to formal reviews;
- author follow-ups;
- substantive vs merge-only commits;
- review decision;
- CI status as evidence only, not as a pre-review or merge-when-ready gate;
- labels and merge-queue membership.

**Redundant-review guard.** The converse of the freshness invariant: when the most recent comment or review on the PR was authored by a repository member (GitHub `authorAssociation` of `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR` — including the acting login), the ball is in the contributor's court and there is no unacknowledged follow-up to respond to. Do not dispatch a redundant review of the same head. This guard suppresses only redundancy: it never overrides the mandatory re-review triggers below (changed head, queue drop, stale approval, edited author activity), which act on state, not on who spoke last.

**Freshness invariant.** Before accepting `held`, `blocked`, `queued`, or a previously approved no-action result, the sweep must compare the current `headRefOid` with the most recent locally recorded head. A different head is a mandatory re-review candidate (or `update_branch_for_handler` when it conflicts), never an inherited hold. Likewise, an author comment/review created **or edited** after the latest GitHub-visible maintainer comment/review is an unacknowledged follow-up even if a later local event recorded a hold. Local event timestamps are observations, not contributor responses. If the scanner cannot prove that it has the relevant recent comment history, it must surface the PR for review rather than preserve the state. Explicit capability-policy deferrals and self/standing skips remain policy decisions, not inherited review states.

**Stale approval plus armed auto-merge is a safety defect, not bookkeeping.** When dismiss-stale-reviews is not enabled on the repo, GitHub keeps reporting `reviewDecision: APPROVED` after a new commit lands, so an unreviewed head can sit armed to merge with nothing surfacing it — the scanner's `head_changed_since_local_event` is the only signal. Treat this as a priority case, not a formality: compare the approving review's `commit.oid` against the live `headRefOid`, and when they differ, review the delta before anything merges. Resolve it by making the record honest — review the new commit and re-approve on the current head, or disarm auto-merge — never by leaving the stale approval to carry.

This applies with *more* force when the post-approval commit is maintainer-authored (a fixup pushed onto the contributor's branch). Maintainer commits are the least likely to receive a second look and frequently carry rules-correctness changes and cross-file renames. Verify a maintainer fixup to the same standard as contributor code — grep-verify its CR claims, confirm rename censuses via the compiler rather than `rg`, and check that any newly exercised code path has a test — before re-approving on it.

## Maintainer-Caused Staleness

Before blocking a PR on "needs rebase", classify **why** it went stale. Causation, not size, decides who does the work.

- **Maintainer-caused** — main's own refactor churn invalidated the branch, or a PR merged during the review window rewrote the same seam. Signature: the branch was fine when it was opened or last reviewed, and it broke without the author touching it. **The maintainer does the rebase/port.** The maintainer-fixup size cap in the `blocked` route does NOT apply here: it caps discretionary fixups, and this is not discretionary. If we deleted the API out from under a contributor, we are the ones who know the replacement, and the contributor should not pay for our campaign. Porting a branch across an in-flight internal refactor is legitimate maintainer work at any size.
- **Contributor-caused** — fork hygiene (unrelated history, an orphan or force-pushed branch, no merge-base), or the author's own change colliding with long-settled main code. Bounce it, unless it is mechanically cheap to fix, in which case just fix it.

A PR can be stale for both reasons at once, and can also carry substantive blockers of its own. Rebasing it does not clear those — resolve the staleness, then re-review the delta on the new head.

**A compile error is not proof of contributor fault — check ancestry first.** `E0004` non-exhaustive-match failures from a PR's own new enum variants look exactly like contributor sloppiness ("you added a variant and missed the match arms") and are the easiest misattribution in the whole loop. They are frequently ours: main adds a *new* match site over an existing enum after the branch was written, and a PR that was complete when authored is now missing an arm in a file it never touched.

The question to answer is not "which is newer" but **"did the branch ever contain the failing code?"** Ask it by ancestry, never by timestamp — commit dates are author/committer metadata, not push time, so a rebase, an amend, or a long-delayed push all skew a date comparison, and a squash-merged main commit carries a date unrelated to when its content landed:

```bash
# 1. Did the failing file even exist at the PR head? Often the whole answer.
#    Use ls-tree, NOT `cat-file -e <sha>:<path>` — see the warning below.
[ -n "$(git ls-tree <headOid> <file-with-the-error>)" ] \
  && echo "file present at head" \
  || echo "file absent at head — the branch never had it"

# 2. Which commit introduced the match site, and is it in the branch's history?
site=$(git log -S '<missing-symbol>' --format=%H -1 -- <file-with-the-error>)
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$site" <headOid> \
  && echo "in the branch's history — the author could have covered it" \
  || echo "NOT in the branch's history — maintainer-caused"

# 3. Is the file in the PR's own diff at all?
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/files --paginate --jq '[.[].filename]'
```

**Do not use `git cat-file -e "$sha:<path>"` for step 1.** In this environment the `<rev>:<path>` form is corrupted before git sees it: the `:` plus the path's first character is swallowed, so `"$head:crates/…"` reaches git as `<sha>rates/…` and dies with `fatal: Not a valid object name`. Quoting does not help — the rewrite happens above the shell (set `RTK_DISABLED=1` and it stops). Paired with the `2>/dev/null || echo "file absent"` idiom this fails **silently and in the maintainer-blaming direction**: every path beginning with a letter git's rev-parse treats as a modifier reports "the branch never had it", which reads as proof of maintainer-caused staleness for a file the branch does have. `git ls-tree <sha> <path>` takes the rev and path as separate arguments and is unaffected. Verified 2026-07-24 on real PR heads where `cat-file` claimed absent and `ls-tree` showed the blob.

If the failing site is not an ancestor of the head, or the file is absent from the head or from the PR's own file list, the contributor could not have covered it: this is maintainer-caused staleness, **we** port it at any size, and the review must say so explicitly rather than leaving a blocker the author cannot act on. Tell them not to rebase on our account.

Sanity-check the probe before trusting a clean result: a commit you know *is* in the branch's history (`git merge-base origin/main <headOid>`) must report `ancestor`. A check that returns "not an ancestor" for everything is broken, not exonerating. Timestamps remain useful as human-readable colour in the review comment — label them "committed at", never "pushed at" — but they must not be the test.

The same procedure applies to a whole board of red jobs sharing one root cause: diagnose the single cause before attributing eight failures to the author.

**Textual vs semantic staleness.** `mergeStateStatus` is a textual check and is not evidence the branch is healthy:

- *Textual* (`DIRTY` / `CONFLICTING`) — announces itself. Cheapest case.
- *Semantic* (`BEHIND`, or even `MERGEABLE`) — git merges it without a single conflict and it still does not compile, or worse, compiles and silently drops behavior. This is strictly nastier than `DIRTY` precisely because nothing flags it. A `MERGEABLE` branch sitting under a refactor that deleted a type it depends on will report clean right up until the build fails.

**Never resolve a semantic conflict by picking a side.** Where both sides changed the same seam, name the behavior each side contributes, then require **a discriminating test from each side green on the rebased head** before approving. Taking `--ours` or `--theirs` on a seam both PRs deliberately modified silently drops one of them, and by construction neither PR's own tests will catch it.

**Mechanics.** Push to the contributor's branch only when `maintainerCanModify` is true. Rebase their commits preserving `%an`/`%ae`, and put the port or conflict resolution in a separate follow-up commit trailing `Co-authored-by:` the contributor — their work stays theirs, and the diff shows exactly what we changed and why. Re-verify locally before pushing; do not push a port that only compiles.

## Review Bar

The bar is still owned by `review-impl` and `pr-contribution-handler`:

- correct architectural seam;
- idiomatic implementation at that seam;
- maintainability and building-block reuse;
- value proportional to blast radius;
- discriminating tests that would fail on revert;
- rules/CR evidence when the repo policy enables the MTG Comprehensive Rules domain;
- no unresolved blocking feedback.

The CLI may recommend that a PR is ready for handler execution only when its structured gates say so, but the recommendation is advisory. Queue readiness is never satisfied from cache; the executor must live-check GitHub.

### Judging the seam

**"Reuses existing machinery" is not the same as "correct seam."** A PR that adds no enum variant, no `bool`, and no new enforcement code reads as architecturally clean and will pass a quick review — but reusing the *wrong* existing mechanism is still a wrong-seam defect, and it is harder to spot precisely because every proliferation heuristic says yes.

Before crediting a seam as correct, ask which existing authority already claims this rule, and whether the PR extended that one:

- **Grep for the rule, not the symbol.** `rg "CR 115\.3" crates/engine/` finds the code that already asserts ownership of the behavior. If an authority already cites the rule the PR is implementing, the PR belongs *there* — extending it — not beside it.
- **Check whether the existing authority is one type-parameter short.** The common shape is an authority that implements half a rule (`HashSet<ObjectId>` where the rule says "object **or player**") and silently drops the other half via a `_ => None`. Widening it fixes the whole class at once; bolting on a parallel mechanism entrenches the split.
- **Two mechanisms for one rule is the defect.** If after the PR one half of a rule is enforced on one path set and the other half on a different path set, that is wrong-seam regardless of how little code was added. Trace both the selection path and the validation path before concluding a fix is complete.
- **Look for the repo asking for the primitive.** Strict-fail comments, `EnginePrerequisiteMissing` gaps, and `needed_variant` markers are the codebase naming the general primitive it is waiting for. A PR that special-cases around such a marker instead of satisfying it is adding call sites to unwind later; cite the marker in the review.
- **Weigh serialized-versus-live reach.** A fix written into a serialized field (`card-data.json`) is inert until data regen and only reaches abilities built by that one producer; the equivalent fix in the runtime authority is live immediately and covers every producer. Prefer the runtime authority when both are available.

### Test-only and regression-test PRs

A PR that adds only tests — no engine, parser, or frontend behavior change — must clear a **high value bar before it is worth merging.** The suite already carries extensive coverage, so a new test earns its place only when it meaningfully reduces risk that existing tests do not already cover. A test-only PR is not "safe because it only adds tests"; a redundant or non-discriminating test is net-negative — it slows the suite, dilutes intent, and adds maintenance cost for no signal.

**Start from skepticism about standalone test PRs.** In this repo, bug fixes almost always ship their own regression test in the *same* PR that fixes the bug. So a separate, later PR adding *another* test for an already-fixed issue is usually redundant by construction — the fixing PR already covered it. Before evaluating the test itself, find the PR that fixed the linked issue and check whether it already added a regression test (`gh pr list --search "<issue#> in:body"`, or read the closing commit); if coverage already exists, the new test is duplicative and does **not** clear the bar — record `value-bar` citing the existing test. A standalone test-only PR only makes sense when the coverage genuinely does not already exist: a bug fixed long ago with no test, or a still-uncovered edge of a mechanic. Conversely, if the linked issue is still **open** (the bug is unfixed), a test asserting the fixed behavior is premature — it will fail against current `main`; that is a block until the fix lands, not a merge. Weigh:

- **Does it guard a real, non-obvious regression?** A test pinning a defect that was actually fixed (a linked issue with a genuine bug) clears the bar. A test restating behavior that existing tests already exercise does not.
- **Is it discriminating?** It must fail on the pre-fix code or against a plausible wrong implementation. A test that passes regardless of the behavior it claims to cover is worthless. Verify the `mod` registration in `tests/integration/main.rs` for integration tests — an unregistered test compiles to nothing and shows green (inert false-green).
- **Is the coverage unique?** Grep for existing tests over the same card, mechanic, or issue before accepting. Duplicated coverage of an already-tested path is a reason to decline, not merge.
- **Is the blast radius justified?** Large test files that re-link the engine (see the `no_top_level_test_binaries` guard) must earn their compile cost.

**Evaluate every test-only PR independently.** A series of narrowly scoped test PRs earns no collective presumption of value: each PR must cite the specific existing coverage it does *not* duplicate, name the distinct regression it guards, and demonstrate a failure against the plausible pre-fix or wrong implementation. “This is another test for the same area” is not merge value.

Default to the **`value-bar`** signal — with a concrete "what already covers this" citation — when a test-only PR does not clear this bar, and do not enqueue it on green CI alone. Approve only when the added coverage is genuinely load-bearing. Apply the same discriminating-test standard whether tests ship alone or alongside a fix.

## Review Comment Format

Every review comment the loop posts — a single-mechanic review or a decomposed multi-mechanic pass — uses one structured, evidence-first format. Lead with the verdict, group findings by severity, anchor every finding to `file:line`, and cite evidence inline rather than paraphrasing it.

Structure:

1. **One-line verdict in bold** — the decision and its shape (e.g. "7 of 8 mechanics clean; 1 blocked on a rules defect — recommend splitting the blocked mechanic so the rest land now.").
2. **Findings grouped by severity, most severe first**, under clear headers:
   - `## 🔴 Blocker` — anything that must change before merge. State the defect, anchor it to `file:line`, and give the evidence: the **grep-verified CR number** and/or the **verbatim Oracle text or official ruling** (quoted, never paraphrased — a paraphrase is exactly how a fabricated clause survives review). Then point to the fix: name the existing building block to reuse or the general pattern to adopt, not just "this is wrong."
   - `## 🟡 Non-blocking` — concerns and design smells that can ride along or land as follow-ups; say why each does not block.
   - `## ✅ Clean` (or a praise section) — credit what is right, specifically (verified Oracle text, grep-verified CR annotations, discriminating registered tests). Contributors calibrate on what passed as much as on what failed.
3. **A concrete recommendation in bold** — the actionable next step: `request-changes` with the exact fix, `split` the blocked mechanic (and what to keep on the landing side), `approve on settled green`, and so on.

Reference example: [PR #5534 review](https://github.com/phase-rs/phase/pull/5534#pullrequestreview-4675737531).

Keep the tone specific and grounded: credit correct work, cite evidence for every claim, and avoid contrastive "not X, but Y" filler. The goal is an auditable decision — a maintainer skimming the comment should see the blocker, its evidence, and the fix without opening the diff.

## Authorized Mode

When the user explicitly authorizes maintainer actions, the loop may pass clean PRs to `pr-contribution-handler`. That skill owns assignee locks, checkout/worktree handling, fixups, formal approval, labels, update-branch, enqueue, dequeue, and live GraphQL verification.

When delegating labeling, require the handler to classify by the actual diff: ordinary additive engine, parser, or tooling capabilities are **enhancement** by default, even when they touch several files. Reserve **feature** for a genuinely broad mechanic or product change spanning distinct subsystems (for example, a combo workflow that jointly changes engine rules, priority handling, UI, and AI). Never infer `feature` from a `feat:` title, file count, or author identity.

When delegating a PR with a non-Frontier declaration, state explicitly that the declaration is an elevated-scrutiny signal, **not** a decline authorization. The handler must review the current head against the evidence bar above and may only close for a diff-based or independently enforced reason.

Do not perform GitHub mutations from this skill except ordinary review/comment actions explicitly required by the current sweep and policy-configured deferral labels. Approval, queue, update-branch, dequeue, and merge execution still belongs to `pr-contribution-handler`.

## Drift Rule

`.agents/skills` is a symlink to `.claude/skills`, so `.claude/skills/pr-review-loop/SKILL.md` is the single physical copy for both Claude Code and Codex. Do not create a separate file under `.agents/`; if the symlink is ever replaced with a real directory, restore it rather than maintaining two copies.
