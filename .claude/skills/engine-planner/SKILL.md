# Engine Planner

Produce an implementation plan for the phase.rs engine. Design for the class, not the card. Never propose bandaids, workarounds, or shortcuts — everything lives in its rules-correct place.

This skill produces the plan only. The plan-review loop belongs to the caller — when invoked from `/engine-implementer`, the orchestrator owns the loop. When invoked standalone, run `/review-engine-plan` against the plan yourself and iterate until clean.

## Input

A task description: parser enhancement/fix, or engine mechanic enhancement/fix. May reference cards, Oracle text patterns, CR rules, or coverage gaps.

## Modes

Ordinary mode is the default and produces a full single plan via the Process below. Three additional modes are activated when the caller's spawn inputs name them (the `/engine-implementer` phase-fit pipeline is the caller). Each mode scopes this file's mandatory language explicitly here, in this file — a spawn prompt never overrides this file's text; this section does.

### Charter mode (spawn inputs: a plan or draft plus the phase-fit firing context)

Output contract: a **phase charter**, not a plan.

- **Input mapping (three shapes):** T4-derived decomposition requires explicit resumption after the orchestrator's stop; T1/T2 proactive decomposition remains subject to the shared run limits. A *draft plan*, with whatever findings have accumulated (the initial gate firing on a fresh draft carries none; mid-loop and plan-loop T4 firings carry the round history) → derive the charter from the draft. A *review-clean plan* (scope-freeze or pre-existing-clean firing) → **partition, not re-plan**: carve the converged content into phases; nothing is rewritten, so the split does not invalidate the reviewed artifact. A *review-clean plan with landed candidates* (impl-loop T4) → derive phase 1 from the stabilized current candidate and partition the remainder.
- **Step survival (enumerated):** Step 0 (premise verification) survives — a fabricated premise poisons every phase. Step 1 (identify applicable skills) survives — the checklist inventory informs unit boundaries and seams. Step 2 (analogous trace) survives — it informs seam choice. Step 3 (read every file) survives, scoped to the files the charter's phases will touch. Steps 4 and 5 (the architectural sections and the step-by-step plan) are replaced by the charter output contract below — they apply later, to each phase plan in phase-plan mode.
- **Charter output contract:** linearly ordered phases; per phase, a goal statement, a **scope rule** — the subsystems and anchor paths the phase owns, as literal paths or directories, **no globs** (T2 directory expansion and the orchestrator's `SCOPE_PATHS` materialization consume concrete paths), with the standing inclusion classes `/engine-implementer` defines (compiler-forced sites, shared registration files, comment-only edits) implied rather than enumerated; the orchestrator materializes the list at scope-freeze — the **claims the phase must establish** where it depends on how the code behaves today (a defect live at base, a path unreachable, a gate observing an outcome), each named with the measurement that buys it and never stated as fact — the charter is a contract about sequencing and acceptance, not a snapshot of the code; a verification plan (a phase's discriminating test may be written `DEFERRED(phase n)` naming the landing phase when it structurally cannot exist until a consumer phase lands — the defining property of a dependency seam; that phase's interim verification is structural: green tree, existing suites, unit-level assertions), and a **deferral list** — everything the full task needs that the phase intentionally omits, attributed to the phase that will land it; seam notes (shared files such as `effects/mod.rs`, surfaces held green via strict-failure tags); and a recursive check that no individual phase itself trips the T1∧T2 phase-fit conjunction defined in `/engine-implementer`.
- **Feasibility exit:** if no green-tree seam exists, report that instead of a charter — name every candidate split point and show why each leaves the tree non-compiling or tests red.

### Phase-plan mode (spawn inputs: charter + one phase's entry + its deferral allowlist)

Produce the plan for one chartered phase. Three mandatory sentences in this file are scoped to the phase's chartered content: "Complete every step. Do not skip any."; Step 1's "Every checklist step must appear" — checklist steps belonging to later phases appear as `DEFERRED(phase n)` entries rather than being omitted; and Step 4's Pattern Coverage stop ("If the answer is 1, stop and find the general pattern") — assessed against the **charter's** class attribution, not the phase's own diff, since an infrastructure phase covers zero cards by itself by construction. Verification Matrix rows whose discriminating test structurally cannot exist until a later phase lands are written `DEFERRED(phase n)` with the landing phase named — the same vocabulary the executor authors and both reviewers audit. Phase-plan mode emits the Sizing section for the phase (the measured input for the orchestrator's per-phase re-adjudication).

### Sizing-only mode (spawn input: an existing plan lacking a Sizing section)

Produce the Sizing section alone, derived from the plan body. "Complete every step. Do not skip any." and the mandatory Output contract are scoped to the Sizing output; only the unit-enumeration analysis survives. Used by `/engine-implementer` for pre-existing plans reaching its phase-fit gate.

## Process

Complete every step. Do not skip any.

### Step 0: Verify the premise — confirm the card's actual Oracle text

**Hard gate, before any other step.** If the task references a specific card's abilities, fetch that card's real, current Oracle text from an authoritative source (Scryfall API: `https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=<URL_ENCODED_NAME>`, or MTGJSON) and compare it verbatim against what the task description claims. Do not proceed on memory, on assumed similarity to other cards, or on a task brief's paraphrase of the card's abilities without this independent check.

A downloaded game-state's stored ability `description` field is a second, usually-reliable source, but it is not a substitute for checking Scryfall — a game state only reflects abilities the parser already produced (correctly or not), and can be silent about clauses that don't exist at all.

**Why this is a hard gate:** a wrong premise about what a card does invalidates every subsequent step even if plan review, implementation review, and CI all pass — those loops verify that a design is *executed correctly*, not that its starting premise is *real*. A fabricated ability can survive multiple rounds of architectural review because reviewers by default trust the task brief's description of what the card does; they are not designed to fact-check the card itself. If the plan or implementation review process turns up something that looks off (e.g. a clause with no analogous card, or a CR citation that doesn't fit any existing rule), re-verify the premise before re-deriving the design.

### Step 1: Identify applicable skills

Determine which skill(s) apply and read each that does:

| Skill | When it applies |
|-------|----------------|
| `/add-engine-effect` | New effects or stub completions |
| `/oracle-parser` | Parser-only changes (authoritative parser reference) |
| `/add-keyword` | Keyword abilities |
| `/add-trigger` | Triggered abilities |
| `/add-static-ability` | Static/continuous effects |
| `/add-replacement-effect` | Replacement effects |
| `/add-interactive-effect` | Effects requiring player choices (WaitingFor + GameAction continuations) |
| `/casting-stack-conditions` | Casting flow or stack changes |
| `/add-ai-feature-policy` | Deck-aware AI features — new `DeckFeatures` axis + `TacticalPolicy`/`MulliganPolicy` wiring |
| `/add-frontend-component` | React components for WaitingFor overlays, board elements, or any UI that dispatches `GameAction`s |
| `/add-card-data-pipeline` | Card export shape changes, synthesis functions, coverage-report changes |
| `/add-engine-variant` | Any new enum variant on engine types (mandatory gate) |
| `/card-test` | Any plan whose verification matrix includes a cast-pipeline runtime test (canonical GameScenario/GameRunner recipe + the six test foot-guns) |

Use the skill checklist(s) as the skeleton of the final plan. Every checklist step must appear.

### Step 2: Trace an analogous feature

Find the existing feature most similar to what you're implementing. Trace it end-to-end through every layer it touches: types → parser → resolver → effect handler → tests. Record each file path you followed. **Hard gate** — the plan must name the traced feature and list the full trace path.

### Step 3: Read every file you will touch

Before proposing changes, read every file you plan to modify. Understand existing patterns, abstractions, and conventions in each.

### Step 3.5: Probe design-relevant uncertainties

For each probe, name the design decision its result could change and prefer existing tests, fixtures, commands or supported tool APIs. Small probes and ordinary regression fixtures are in scope; a new verification framework is not implied by an engine task. Honor the caller's execution constraints. In the engine-implementer pipeline, use the supplied original task and scope/attempt history and obey its [task scope](../engine-implementer/SKILL.md#task-scope-and-verification-work) and [run limits](../engine-implementer/SKILL.md#run-limits), including pre-measurement design corrections. If evidence requires machinery beyond those bounds, return the missing evidence to the orchestrator. Standalone planning has the same task boundary without inventing pipeline counters.

Steps 2 and 3 tell you what the code *looks like*. Only a probe that compiles and runs tells you what it
*does*. For a rules engine this intricate, plans built by tracing repeatedly encode plausible-but-wrong
assertions that survive plan review and break at implementation — or ship a predicate that is true for
the wrong reason. Probing early is also the cheap path: a reviewer handed no fresh evidence has nothing
to do but audit your prose, and that loop does not converge.

So probe. A throwaway `#[test]` or scratch driver, compiled and run, is worth more than any amount of
re-reading. Probe whatever the design would change if it turned out false: a predicate's runtime
verdict, which branch is actually taken, an observed count or delta, "X never happens", "this conjunct
is what refuses". Assertions that look obvious from the source are exactly where this pays — the classic
failure is a predicate whose body reads correctly and whose verdict is decided by inputs the source
never mentions. Say plainly which assertions you probed and which you didn't; an unprobed assertion is
fine as long as it is labelled, and dangerous the moment it is quietly promoted to fact.

Three things make a probe worth believing:

- **It reached the code under test.** Print a positive marker beside the verdict — a nonzero count, a
  hit on the production branch, the value at the seam. A zero with no positive control showing the
  instrument fires at all is not a negative result; it is a probe that told you nothing. This is Step
  4's paired-positive-reach-guard rule one step earlier, applied to evidence rather than to tests.
- **It ran against a real board.** Prefer committed fixtures and dumps over synthetic state. Synthetic
  input proves the predicate reads a field; a real board proves what it answers in production.
- **It finished.** A run that died partway still printed everything up to the point it died. If it
  didn't exit cleanly, you didn't measure it.

**Write claims in the form that survives the next edit.** A probe yields a snapshot — a count, a
coordinate, a cardinality. Transcribing it is fragile: the next edit falsifies it, review correctly
flags it, and the repair mints a fresh snapshot for the round after. Prefer the formulation that stays
true — a symbol name over a line number, "every case in §Y" over "the four cases". Where only the figure
carries the information, name the command that regenerates it. **A falsified snapshot is repaired by
reformulating it, not by refreshing it.**

**Probing needs the cargo target lock and a stable tree.** Use an isolated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and the
worktree's absolute path; never build in a checkout another process (e.g. Tilt) owns. Serialize probe
activity behind any active implementation executor on a shared worktree — read-only discovery may run
concurrently. Never put a scratch target dir on tmpfs. Keep one isolated target dir per worktree and
*reuse* it across probes — deleting it between runs buys nothing and re-imposes the full dependency
rebuild that talks planners out of probing in the first place. Isolation does not override a caller's no-build constraint or authorize new tooling; if a required probe cannot run within those constraints,
report the missing evidence. Shared `CARGO_HOME` registry/package-
cache locks are a separate lock domain that target-dir isolation doesn't touch, and can still delay a
build. Capacity is the one thing isolation cannot fix — a fresh target dir costs disk rather than saving
it — so a genuinely full or saturated box is worth naming, and worth probing once it clears.

### Step 4: Answer architectural questions

The plan MUST include these sections with substantive, specific answers:

- **Pattern Coverage** — What class of cards/patterns does this cover? Estimate card count. If the answer is 1, stop and find the general pattern. (In phase-plan mode this stop is assessed against the charter's class attribution — see Modes.)
- **Sizing** (mandatory in ordinary and phase-plan modes) — The unit list, where one *unit* = one coherent mechanic/behavior implementable by a single skill-checklist pass regardless of how many lockstep layers it touches; each unit's registration surfaces and discriminating test; inter-unit dependency edges (infrastructure→consumer); and the expected scope-path count under the phase-fit counting rule (test fixtures and regenerated pipeline data excluded outright; committed generated artifacts and translation mirrors group with their authored source as one path; directory entries expanded to expected changed files before grouping). The `/engine-implementer` phase-fit gate adjudicates its triggers against this section, and `/review-engine-plan` checks it for consistency with the plan body — a plan whose body names N independently tested behaviors must not report fewer units.
- **Building Blocks** — Which existing modules and helpers will you compose from? Reference specific functions by name from `parser/oracle_nom/`, `parser/oracle_util.rs`, `game/filter.rs`, `game/quantity.rs`, `game/ability_utils.rs`, `game/keywords.rs`, etc. Justify any new helper.
- **Logic Placement** — Where does each piece of logic belong (parser vs game vs effects vs types)? Justify each choice.
- **Rust Idioms** — Most idiomatic representation. Typed enums not bools. Exhaustive match not wildcards. Existing type reuse over new types.
- **Nom Compliance** (mandatory if any file under `crates/engine/src/parser/` changes) — For every detection, dispatch, or classification step, specify the exact nom combinator or existing parser function. If the plan describes `contains()`/`starts_with()`/`find()` for parsing dispatch, **STOP and redesign**. The parser IS the detector — try `parse_static_line(text).is_some()` instead of `text.contains("gets ")`.
- **Extension vs Creation** — Does this extend an existing pattern or create a new one? Justify any new pattern.
- **Analogous Trace** — Name the traced feature and the full file path (e.g., "Traced `Scry` through `types/ability.rs` → `parser/oracle_effect/imperative.rs` → `game/effects/scry.rs` → `game/effects/mod.rs`").
- **Variant Discoverability** (if adding any enum variant) — Confirm `cargo engine-inventory` was consulted and run the `/add-engine-variant` checklist.
- **Verification Matrix** — For every behavioral claim, specify the changed seam/function, production entry point, runtime test to add or update, revert-failing assertion, sibling/negative cases, hostile fixtures, and coverage status impact. Cast-pipeline runtime tests must follow the `/card-test` recipe (GameScenario + `GameRunner::cast(..).resolve()` + `CastOutcome` deltas, verbatim Oracle text). Every planned negative assertion must name its paired positive reach-guard — a bare negative that an upstream short-circuit (e.g. `Effect::Unimplemented` early-return) can satisfy vacuously is not a test. Hostile fixtures are per-claim/per-seam, not a single global negative test: include the applicable negative sibling / adjacent grammar or enum variant, empty/decline/no-legal-choice path, multi-authority case (two permissions/sources/costs, source or controller change, owner vs controller, prior tracked-set producer, etc.), and the first production branch the fixture reaches (`is_empty`, `is_none`, enum match arm, variant guard). If a hostile row is unreachable, prove why from code. For parser changes, explicitly state whether any Oracle text is accepted while semantics remain deferred; if yes, plan how coverage remains red/honest via `Effect::unimplemented`, an equivalent strict-failure marker, or unchanged unsupported coverage.
- **Identity / Provenance Contract** — For any "this way", "that source", "chosen", "cast using", "from among them", selected target/mode, replacement predicate, duration-bound effect, or controller/owner-relative text, specify the source phrase/rules concept, selected authority type and id/value, binding time, live vs snapshotted/latched semantics, storage location, consuming function, invalidation/expiration behavior, and the multi-authority hostile fixture that proves the binding.

### Step 5: Write the plan

Step-by-step implementation plan using the skill checklist as your guide. For each step:

- Exact file path to modify
- Specific changes (executable without ambiguity)
- Any CR rules that apply, verified by grepping `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`

## Output

Return the finalized plan including every mandatory architectural section. The caller will run it through `/review-engine-plan` (and loop until clean).
