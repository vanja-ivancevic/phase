## Summary

<!-- What this PR changes and why. One or two sentences. -->

## Files changed

<!-- Every changed path, as a short bullet list. -->

## Track

<Developer | Non-developer>

## LLM

Model: <actual Frontier model identifier or reported name | not-applicable (no LLM)>
Tier: <Frontier | not-applicable (no LLM)>
Thinking: <high | max | not-applicable (no LLM)>

<!-- Keep Model and Tier as exact, standalone canonical lines. AI-assisted PRs
must report their actual Frontier model, Tier: Frontier, and thinking level.
If your harness does not expose an exact model identifier, report the name it
does give you — e.g. "Model: gpt-5.6-sol (via GitHub Copilot; canonical id not
exposed)" — rather than guessing an identifier. See AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md
§0.1.1. -->

## Implementation method (required)

Method: /engine-implementer
<!-- Or: Method: not-applicable — <specific non-engine reason> -->

> [!NOTE]
> Any change to `crates/engine/` game logic — parser, effects, resolver,
> targeting, rules behavior — is expected to go through `/engine-implementer`.
> The "not used" box is for changes that genuinely fall outside that scope.

## Claimed parse impact

None.
<!-- List exact card names only when the parse-diff changes cards. -->

## Scope Expansion

None.
<!-- Describe any change that crosses the issue/card's stated scope: the item it closes and why leaving it would ship the defect. -->

## Validation Failures

None.
<!-- Replace with each unresolved validation failure or shipped residual finding, with its evidence and follow-up. -->

## CI Failures

None.
<!-- Replace with the unresolved CI failure and its evidence. -->
