// #7692 could not repair the article, because `t("targeting.one", { target })`

// on the noun's gender, its initial sound, and the case the frame governs — none
// of which the catalog can see through a placeholder. It shipped a bracket hedge
// (`un(a)`) in it/pt and DECLINED de and pl outright.
//
// Whole-phrase keys retire the composition, and with it BOTH declines. This
// suite is REWRITTEN rather than deleted: the declines were decisions with
// reasons, and deleting them would erase the record that they were decisions
// rather than oversights. It now pins the RESOLVED state, and each retired
// decline carries the evidence that retired it.
//
// RESOLVED, de. The decline's stated reason was that repairing German needs
// case-aware phrasing because "`one` and `upToOne` do not even govern the same
// case". That parenthetical is FALSE and is withdrawn. German "bis zu" has two
// uses: as a PREPOSITION meaning "up to a limit" it takes dative, but as a
// QUANTIFIER modifying a numeral it is transparent, and MTG uses the second. A
// form attested in Wizards' German card text is impossible under a
// dative-governing "bis zu": "bis zu einen" is masculine ACCUSATIVE only, and it
// appears in 16 cards of client/public/card-data.de.json — cards whose
// case-folded `oracle_text` contains that phrase with `einen` as a complete
// word, which is also its raw-substring count, so the figure does not move with
// the method. One would be a typo; sixteen is a grammar. A corroborating count
// for "bis zu ein" used to stand here and is REMOVED rather than relabelled: it
// is method-sensitive by a factor of six, because `ein` is a prefix of `eine`,
// `einen` and `einer`, so it read as corroboration while being an artifact. The
// shipped `upToOne.creature` value is attested far more widely and needs no
// inference: "bis zu eine Kreatur" appears as a complete phrase in 228 cards
// (262 by raw substring — 34 of those are "bis zu eine Kreaturenkarte", a
// different noun sharing the prefix, which is the same raw-vs-bounded artifact
// that retired the "bis zu ein" count). Feminine dative is `einer`, so `eine` is
// accusative there too, in Wizards' own text. Both
// frames are accusative, so the real German defect was the hard-coded FEMININE
// `eine` alone — wrong for Spieler, Zauberspruch and Planeswalker (m) and for
// Ziel and Permanent (n), in both frames.
//
// RESOLVED, pl. The decline was RIGHT: "do jednego" governs the genitive while
// every noun value was nominative. Every `upToOne` value is now genitive.
//
// FLAGGED, not settled, in both de and pl. Case here is assigned by a governing
// verb and this caption HAS none, so no corpus can settle it. The caption is a
// bare noun phrase, and the corpus offers no near-miss: the verbless shape the
// counterexamples below take — a bare activation cost plus a P/T delta — occurs
// zero times among the 1205 texts carrying the QUANTIFIER use, "bis zu" before a
// numeral. That is a measured absence of ONE shape, not a proof that all 1205
// carry a governing verb; a verb-list sweep for the stronger claim was tried and
// discarded as too contaminated to cite. Two earlier drafts of this sentence
// overreached on the same axis, each stating at "every card" scope what the
// evidence supports only at "every card carrying THIS construction" scope.
// "Every printed German card is a sentence" — FALSE: 222 have single-token
// oracle text, bare keywords like "Fliegend", against 29,535 multi-word.
// "Every bis-zu text has a governing verb" — FALSE: six cards' entire text
// is the verbless "{U}: +1/+0 bis zum Ende des Zuges", where
// "bis zum" is the dative PREPOSITION, not the quantifier. Neither counterexample
// class carries the quantifier use, so the conclusion is unaffected. Resolved to
// accusative because this slot's own fallback is an imperative ("Wähle ein
// Ziel", TargetingOverlay.tsx) and the repo's choice-prompt register is
// imperative throughout. MTG has never been printed in Polish — MTGJSON's
// foreignData carries no Polish at all — so there is no authority to defer to
// and no corpus to check. Both locales ship flagged for native review.
