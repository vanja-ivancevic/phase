/**
 * U17 — the commander designation's submission channel at the P2P host seam.
 *
 * CR 903.3: "Each deck has a legendary card designated as its commander." This
 * suite asserts the host carries that designation from the wire to the adapter;
 * CR 903.1 scopes the designation to the Commander variant, which is why the
 * empty-designation row is a legal payload and not a hostile one.
 *
 * Every test drives the REAL host seam (`handleGuestMessage` / `submitHostDeck`
 * / the private `handleDeckSubmission` funnel) against a stubbed adapter,
 * rather than asserting a message shape.
 *
 * WHAT THIS HARNESS DOES NOT RUN: `handleGuestMessage` is invoked directly with
 * a plain object literal. `validateDraftMessage` runs UPSTREAM of it, in
 * `decodeDraftWireMessage` -> `draftPeerSession.ts`'s `conn.on("data")`, and
 * this harness constructs no peer session. So no row here may name
 * `validateSubmitDeck`, its bound or its floor as the branch it reaches —
 * every validator claim belongs to `draftProtocol.test.ts`, which is the only
 * suite in `client/src` that runs the validator at all.
 *
 * Modelled on `p2pDraftPick.test.ts`, including its `REVERT-PROBE:`
 * convention: every test names the exact line whose reversion it catches.
