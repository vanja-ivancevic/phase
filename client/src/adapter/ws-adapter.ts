/**
 * Wire-protocol version the client speaks. Must match `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in
 * `crates/server-core/src/protocol.rs`. Bump in lockstep when either side
 * adds, removes, renames, or changes the type of a protocol variant field.
 *
 * 73 — `CastingVariantChoiceOption` gained required `face`, making a paused
 *      Fuse split-card menu an exact `(variant, face)` tuple. This integrated
 *      state also carries a resolution-owned modal choice's additional cost so
 *      a paid graveyard cast cannot lose it across face election. Old snapshots
 *      cannot safely bind either payload, so full-game peers must refuse skew.
 * 72 — `ResolutionCastFacePolicy` replaces the legacy free-cast-window filter,
 *      and `WaitingFor.CastOffer { kind: GraveyardPaidCast }` carries two additive
 *      fields: additional_cost (Ogre Battlecaster's "{R}{R} in addition to its
 *      other costs", CR 601.2b) and installed_triggers (the delayed triggers a
 *      declined offer withdraws). Both are serde-defaulted, so a v71 peer
 *      parses a v72 offer — and then pays the offered card at its printed
 *      cost alone while the v72 host charges the addition. The offer also
 *      opens for seven more printed cards (the paid "cast target … card from
 *      your graveyard" class, CR 608.2g) that v71 granted a lingering
 *      permission instead. Exact-match refuses the pairing. P2P moves in
 *      lockstep (wire 54); lobby messages are unchanged. See PROTOCOL_VERSION
 *      in crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs for the full entry.
 * 71 — DraftKind.Winston and DraftAction::SharedStackDecision are serialized
 *      by draft WebSocket messages. A PARSE bump like 27 and 34, not a
 *      capability bump like 24 — but a CONDITIONAL one: neither type carries
 *      a serde fallback variant, so a v70 peer fails deserialization outright
 *      on "Winston" or on the SharedStackDecision tag, and a v71 peer cannot
 *      round-trip a frame a v70 peer would have to invent. The break runs in
 *      BOTH directions, and for the types named so far only for a Winston
 *      pod's frames.
 *      DraftDelta::SharedStackDecisionApplied, the two shared-stack
 *      DraftError variants (InvalidSharedStackConfiguration and
 *      SharedStackDecisionRefused — a third, SharedStackRequiresHumanSeats,
 *      existed while this entry was first written and was deleted when
 *      shared-stack pods gained bot seats) and PickStatus.Waiting ride the
 *      same condition.
 *      TWO FIELDS DO NOT RIDE IT, and they are the exception to the sentence
 *      above: SeatPublicView.drafted_card_count and
 *      DraftPlayerView.distribution are REQUIRED, non-optional fields on
 *      every kind's frames, so a v70 server's view fails to satisfy a v71
 *      client's shape for Premier, Traditional, Sealed and CommanderDraft too
 *      — not just Winston. That is what this version gate is for and it
 *      already refuses the mismatch. drafted_card_count is a count and never
 *      an identity, and is public in every kind (a pick-and-pass seat's total
 *      follows from the pick number); distribution is a procedure fact
 *      published for the same reason launch_capability is, and deliberately
 *      NOT status-gated so a surface outliving the draft can still tell a pile
 *      pod from a passing one.
 *      DraftPlayerView.{shared_stack, play_first_chooser},
 *      SpectatorDraftView.shared_stack and DraftSession.shared_stack are
 *      additive and serde-optional, which is why their TypeScript mirrors are
 *      declared optional — they are listed because 71 carries them, not
 *      because they force it. play_first_chooser is ADVISORY: no engine path
 *      enforces it, because game one's starting player still comes from
 *      CR 103.1's contest. Lobby messages are unchanged: draftKind is a
 *      length-bounded string. See PROTOCOL_VERSION in
 *      crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs for the full entry.
 * 70 — OutsideGameChoiceSource.BoosterPack replaced set_code with a required
 *      origin: PackOrigin ({ type: "Set", data } or { type: "Cube" }), so an
 *      opened pack's OutsideGameChoice no longer decodes on a v69 peer and a
 *      v69 frame renders no pack origin here. The exact handshake refuses the
 *      pairing. P2P moves in lockstep; lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 69 — GameEvent gained the tagged variant ExtraTurnCreated { player_id,
 *      anchor }. Event-bearing full-server frames can now carry that tag, so
 *      the exact handshake must refuse v68 peers that do not share the variant
 *      contract. P2P moves in lockstep; lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 68 — PendingManaAbility.chosen_tappers changed from Vec<ObjectId> to
 *      Option<Vec<ObjectId>> (#8698), so an ANSWERED zero-tapper selection of
 *      the CR 107.3a X-sentinel form (X=0) is distinguishable from a selection
 *      stage nobody has answered. A PARSE bump like 67: the field carries no
 *      serde default, so the pre-68 unanswered shape — which omitted the field
 *      entirely — is a missing-field error rather than a silent decode. The
 *      reverse skew is what made the bump mandatory: Some([]) serializes as
 *      `chosen_tappers: []`, which a v67 build reads through its is_empty()
 *      gate as *unanswered*, re-surfacing the same PayCost prompt forever.
 * 67 — DerivedViews.dungeon_rooms entries gained required `card` and `rooms`
 *      fields, carrying the dungeon card's Scryfall identity and the whole
 *      room graph (each room's edges plus its position on the printed card).
 *      A PARSE bump like 66, not a capability bump like 24: neither field is
 *      serde-optional, so a v66 peer fails deserialization on any snapshot
 *      where a player is venturing rather than degrading silently. The
 *      reverse skew is equally hard — this client destructures `card`
 *      unconditionally to resolve the card art, so a v66 host would throw in
 *      render, not merely omit the map panel.
 * 65 — DraftMatchStart now announces the exact Full-session identity for the
 *      spawned match. Draft reconnect attaches the authenticated draft seat
 *      to that Full-session lifetime, and Full follow-up frames carry the key
 *      needed to reject stale-generation traffic. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 61 — Effect.ChooseCounterKind gained domain and chooser (CR 608.2d): the
 *      population a counter-kind choice draws from, and whether the game draws
 *      one at random instead of prompting. Serde-additive, so an older payload
 *      reads as the on-target/controller form; the other direction drops the
 *      printed list and the random draw silently, which is the #7796 defect
 *      itself. Abilities ride inside GameObject, so every GameState frame
 *      carries the shape. The full handshake refuses stale peers. Lobby
 *      messages are unchanged.
 * 60 — DerivedViews.back_face_spell_costs publishes, for each card the viewer
 *      may cast whose player chooses a spell face at cast time (a split card
 *      such as a Room, a spell//spell MDFC — CR 709.3 + CR 712.11b), the live
 *      cost of the OTHER face; spell_costs reports the live face only. The
 *      cost badge renders both faces from this map. Serde-additive, but the
 *      client renders the map directly, so an older server would silently
 *      show a Room's single-face badge again. The full handshake refuses
 *      stale peers. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 59 — InteractionResponseSpec.shortcut.preview changed from a single optional
 *      InteractionShortcutPreview to an Array<InteractionShortcutPreview>, one
 *      element per offerable count, and each element gained an allocation list
 *      stating the declaration's shape over that element's count. The retype is
 *      the break; the added list is not — it is default and skip-if-empty and
 *      parses in both directions. A PARSE bump like 23, 36 and 42, not a
 *      capability bump like 24, and asymmetric: a v58 peer always emits the
 *      preview key (null or an object) and neither deserializes into a list, so
 *      v58 → v59 fails on every shortcut offer; v59 → v58 fails only when a
 *      preview is actually carried, because an empty list omits the key and a
 *      v58 peer reads that as absent. No shim ships.
 *      MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_PROTOCOL below and MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL in
 *      crates/server-core/src/protocol.rs are each equal to their own
 *      PROTOCOL_VERSION, so the pairing is refused at the handshake — which
 *      matters here because this client parses server frames with JSON.parse and
 *      would otherwise read the new shape silently. See PROTOCOL_VERSION in
 *      crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs for the full entry.
 * 58 — `DraftPlayerView::commanders_required` publishes the procedure-owned
 *      commander designation count. The client renders designation controls
 *      from this required field rather than inferring them from `DraftKind`.
 * 57 — `GameAction::BeginResolveAll` gained `scope: ResolveAllScope` (`Own`
 *      binds only the requester and resolves immediately; `Shared` opens the
 *      table-wide consent protocol), and `PriorityPassingMode` gained
 *      `FullControl`, which is now engine-authoritative rather than a
 *      frontend-only toggle.
 * 56 — Host-only authoritative-state export request/response variants. Native
 *      P2P sends each player a redacted view, so the host must ask its local
 *      server for the trusted engine envelope rather than export that view.
 * 55 — DerivedViews.room_half_identities publishes both halves of every
 *      battlefield Room in printed order, resolved through the COPIED halves
 *      for a permanent that copies a Room (CR 709.5b + CR 707.2). The unlock
 *      offer names the half and shows its unlock cost (CR 709.5e) from this
 *      map; an enter-as-copy recipient carries neither on its own printed
 *      card. Serde-additive, but the client renders the map directly, so an
 *      older server would silently label every door "Tap for Mana" again. The
 *      full handshake refuses stale peers. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 54 — CreateDraftWithSettings now carries a tagged DraftSourceIntent. A
 *      Chaos client sends candidate set codes only; the Full server resolves
 *      and persists the private seat-by-round assignment matrix. The full
 *      handshake refuses stale peers. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 53 — DraftPlayerView.launch_capability publishes the engine-authorized
 *      post-draft multiplayer launch. The client renders this procedure-owned
 *      capability instead of inferring it from DraftKind; an older server
 *      would omit it and silently hide a completed Commander pod's launch.
 *      The full-game handshake refuses that capability mismatch. Lobby
 *      messages are unchanged.
 * 52 — DerivedViews.storm_count publishes the engine-owned number of copies a
 *      current Storm trigger will create, or a newly cast Storm spell would
 *      create. The field is serde-additive, but this client renders that
 *      scalar directly rather than deriving Storm from raw state; a v51 host
 *      would silently omit the HUD status. The full-game handshake refuses
 *      that capability mismatch. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 51 — Casting permissions gained a typed lifetime: ExileWithAltAbilityCost
 *      gained duration and source_id, ExileWithAltCost gained source_id beside
 *      the duration it already had (additive, serde
 *      defaults), and Duration gained the WhileControllingHost and
 *      WhileHostOnBattlefield variants (CR 611.2b). Each new Duration tag is a
 *      one-way parse break — a v50 peer cannot deserialize a snapshot
 *      containing it — so the handshake refuses the pairing instead of
 *      degrading.
 * 50 — FormatConfig gained default_deck_copy_limit, the resolved per-format
 *      deck-copy ceiling (CR 100.2a / CR 100.2b / CR 903.5b) max_deck_copies
 *      and the deck-compatibility admission path now both read, replacing
 *      per-function hardcoded literals and bare-GameFormat-derived defaults
 *      so the two authorities can't disagree. A CAPABILITY bump like 24: the
 *      field is serde-optional (fail-closed UpTo(1), the tightest possible
 *      cap), so a peer missing it still deserializes GameState cleanly — but
 *      silently loses the format's real declared limit and falls back to the
 *      singleton cap, wrongly rejecting a legal 4-of deck rather than
 *      admitting one it shouldn't. Symmetric in both directions. See
 *      PROTOCOL_VERSION in crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs for the full
 *      entry; lobby carriers move too, see LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION 3 below.
 * 49 — Full-server DraftPlayerView payloads require public-seat
 *      active_pack_count. An older v48 server can complete the handshake yet
 *      omit that additive field while this client accepts the JSON, leaving it
 *      unable to render a seat's active-pack presence. The Full handshake
 *      refuses that capability mismatch. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 48 — Full-server DraftPlayerView payloads require the engine-owned
 *      pick_selection_mode. An older server can omit it while this client
 *      accepts the JSON, then silently treats an ordered Commander Draft pick
 *      as direct selection. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 47 — Resolution-time optional fixed sacrifice payments add a typed
 *      replacement-resumable continuation to GameState.
 * 46 — QuantityRef.Aggregate and QuantityRef.TrackedSetAggregate were
 *      replaced in serialized GameState payloads by the canonical
 *      QuantityRef.PropertyAggregate tag with a validated source object. New
 *      peers migrate both old input tags, but a v45 peer cannot deserialize
 *      the canonical tag emitted by v46, so the full-game handshake refuses
 *      that one-way parse mismatch. Lobby messages are unchanged.
 * 45 — GameState gained serialized cast-occurrence provenance and prepared-copy links.
 * 44 — Resolution-time optional PayCost(OneOf) branch choice added a
 *      serialized WaitingFor/GameAction pair.
 * 43 — Engine-owned stack-resolution automation retired the legacy native
 *      Resolve All request/result wire messages.
 * 42 — FormatConfig.deck_size changed from a bare u16 to the adjacently
 *      tagged DeckSizeRule enum (Minimum(u16) / Exactly(u16)), because
 *      CR 903.13f(1) makes Commander Draft a command-zone format with a
 *      minimum rather than an exact size, and GameFormat gained a
 *      CommanderDraft variant (CR 903.13a). A PARSE bump like 23 and 36, not a
 *      capability bump like 24: FormatConfig::deck_size carries neither a
 *      serde default nor a deserialize_with, so a v41 peer's "deck_size": 60
 *      fails against the adjacently tagged enum and a v42 peer's
 *      {"type":"Minimum","data":60} fails against a v41 u16 — the break is
 *      unconditional and runs in BOTH directions, for every format.
 *      GameState.format_config's serde default does NOT rescue it: a
 *      field-level default applies only when the key is ABSENT, and an old
 *      peer sends the key present with the old inner shape, so the default
 *      never runs. The GameFormat::CommanderDraft variant is the second and
 *      narrower half — it breaks only when that variant is actually
 *      serialized.
 * 41 — Operational failure responses are correlated to their pending action.
 * 40 — Action rejection responses carry engine-owned structured context.
 * 39 — ManaRestriction.CannotCastSpellFromZone adds a serialized
 *      GameState/ManaUnit restriction used by Karolina Dean. Older peers
 *      cannot deserialize that externally tagged enum variant.
 * 38 — WaitingFor.ChooseObjectsSelection publishes the resolving effect's
 *      min and optional max bounds. Older clients silently ignore these
 *      additive fields and offer selections outside the engine-authoritative
 *      range, so the full-game handshake refuses that capability mismatch.
 * 37 — PayCostKind::TapCreatures changed from { aggregate:
 *      Option<TapCreaturesAggregate> } to a required { mode:
 *      TapCreaturesSelectionMode } (Fixed/VariableX/Aggregate) — the fix that
 *      also unlocks the u32::MAX X-sentinel tap-cost form (Glacian,
 *      Powerstone Engineer + 8 sibling cards, #7799). mode carries no serde
 *      default: a GameState snapshot paused mid-TapCreatures payment
 *      (Crew/Saddle/Teamwork/Conspire, or the newly-unlocked X-sentinel form)
 *      under the old aggregate shape now fails deserialization rather than
 *      risk silently misclassifying an aggregate payment as fixed-count (or
 *      vice versa) — exactly the ambiguity TapCreaturesSelectionMode exists to
 *      make unrepresentable. Old and new peers can't parse each other's
 *      serialized snapshots while such a payment is in flight.
 * 36 — WaitingFor.ChooseDungeon.options changed from DungeonId[] to
 *      DungeonPreview[], and ChooseDungeonRoom dropped option_names, gained a
 *      required dungeon_name, and changed options from number[] to
 *      RoomPreview[], so each option carries the room's printed name and
 *      room-ability text (CR 309.4b-c). A PARSE bump like 23, not a capability
 *      bump like 24: none of the new fields carry a serde default, so a v35
 *      peer fails deserialization on a dungeon-choice GameState outright
 *      rather than degrading silently. DerivedViews.dungeon_rooms rides along
 *      in the same bump — it IS serde-optional, but this client deleted its
 *      dungeon_progress room-index derivation, so a v35 server that omits it
 *      would leave this client rendering no dungeon badge at all.
 * 35 — DerivedViews.current_target_kind publishes the engine's CR 115.1
 *      classification of the live target announcement. A CAPABILITY bump like
 *      24 and 32, not a parse bump: the field is serde-optional, but this
 *      client deleted inferTargetNoun, so a v34 server that omits it would
 *      leave this client naming no target at all — silently, with no parse
 *      error to catch it. The handshake is the only place that pairing is
 *      refusable.
 * 34 — DraftKind.CommanderDraft (CR 903.13a) is serialized by draft WebSocket
 *      messages, and DraftAction::Pick renamed card_instance_id to
 *      card_instance_ids: Vec<String> for a whole CR 903.13b pick step. A
 *      PARSE bump, not a capability bump — the renamed field carries no serde
 *      default. See PROTOCOL_VERSION in crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs
 *      for the full entry, including what it does and does not gate on the
 *      lobby.
 * 33 — LegendCandidateIdentity adds Unknown so face-down legend candidates do
 *      not publish an affirmative original/copy identity.
 * 32 — DerivedViews.legend_candidate_identities publishes the engine-authored
 *      original/copy/token-copy identity for each active legend-rule choice. The
 *      field is serde-optional, but the client deliberately no longer derives this
 *      rules-sensitive identity from raw objects; an older server would silently
 *      omit every choice identity.
 * 31 — WaitingFor::LoopShortcut publishes the engine-issued declaration, and
 *      InteractionResponseSpec::Shortcut publishes preview, the per-axis
 *      consequence of the offered count. Both are optional and neither type
 *      sets deny_unknown_fields, so a v30 peer still PARSES the frame — a
 *      capability bump like 24, not a parse bump. UNLIKE 24, no pairing is left
 *      for the capability gap to bite in, so this entry names no silent-drop
 *      hazard: full-game floors are exact-match on BOTH sides
 *      (MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_PROTOCOL below, and MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL in
 *      crates/server-core/src/protocol.rs, each equal to their own
 *      PROTOCOL_VERSION), so a v31/v30 full-game pair is refused at the

 *      does exist is lobby-only (LOBBY_MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_PROTOCOL below /
 *      MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL in crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs) and it
 *      cannot carry this capability either: DeclareShortcut rides
 *      ClientMessage::Action, which LobbyClientMessage has no variant for at
 *      all, and which reject_if_disabled in crates/phase-server/src/main.rs
 *      answers under ServerMode::LobbyOnly with an explicit rejection rather
 *      than a silent drop.
 * 30 — Serialized player-action completion provenance and modal continuations.
 * 27 — Added DraftKind.Sealed, serialized by draft WebSocket messages.
 * 26 — Added ActionNoOp acknowledgement for accepted transport no-ops.
 * 25 — DebugCardEntries added a serialized, private resolution frame for
 *      multi-card sandbox battlefield entries that pause for replacement or
 *      as-enters choices. Old peers cannot deserialize that GameState shape.
 * 24 — DerivedViews.unbounded_families carries the engine-owned per-seat family
 *      collapse state behind each ∞ badge. A CAPABILITY bump, not a parse bump:
 *      the field is serde-optional, but this client deleted its row-flag
 *      OR-fold derivation, so a v23 server that omits the field would leave
 *      this client rendering NO infinity badges — silently, with no parse error
 *      to catch it. The handshake is the only place that pairing is refusable.
 * 23 — PayableResource::ManaGeneric changed from { per_x } to
 *      { base_cost: ManaCost } (#6410) — a GameState payload field type
 *      change, and base_cost intentionally carries no serde default (a
 *      missing base_cost must fail deserialization, not silently resolve
 *      to a zero-cost payment), so old and new peers can't parse each
 *      other's serialized state.
 * 22 — Viewer interaction projections and semantic object-action identities.
 * 21 — Native P2P host bridge identity and server-authored state revisions.
 * 20 — Actor-scoped priority-passing settings and filtered per-player state.
 * 19 — Connive exact subject snapshots and resident paused post-replacement
 *      drains changed the serialized full-game state. Phase 4 later pinned
 *      the existing v2 resolution wire shape without another protocol change.
 * 17 — Dedicated companion deck slot and typed companion-reveal choices.
 * 16 — Meld pair/attacking-entry choices after the mana-payment preview variants.
 * 15 — Mana-payment preview request/response variants.
 * 75 — ResolutionCastCleanup, its delayed-trigger receipts, and each
 *      receipt-eligible delayed-install origin carry the producer-issued paid
 *      offer owner. Older peers cannot preserve cross-offer isolation through
 *      a paused state handoff.
 * 74 — ResolutionCastCleanup now carries exact delayed-trigger receipts for a
 *      paused paid resolution cast. Older peers cannot preserve the receipt
 *      authority through a state handoff, so this is an exact-match boundary.
 *
 * 14 — PrecastCopyShortcut action and its two WaitingFor variants.
 * 13 — WaitingFor::MulliganBottomCards removed; mulligan bottoming folded
 *      into a MulliganDecisionPhase::BottomCards sub-phase on
 *      WaitingFor::MulliganDecision.

 * message's SEMANTICS change in a way this client must gate behavior on (see 9).
 * A full-game bump must NOT move this number: no lobby variant carries GameState
 * or GameAction, so full-game churn cannot break lobby traffic. Sharing one
 * integer between the two surfaces is what took preview multiplayer down —
 * PROTOCOL_VERSION moved twice for GameState-only changes and the derived lobby
 * window went disjoint from the deployed broker's.
 *
 * 9 — Recoverable credential rotation via idempotent-nonce replay.
 *     RenewTournamentCredential gains an optional `rotation_nonce` field
 *     (#[serde(default)]) — the "a lobby field is added" trigger;
 *     TournamentCredentialRenewed is unchanged. A rotation mints ONLY from the
 *     current secret (recording the superseded secret + that nonce); presenting
 *     the superseded secret with the SAME nonce REPLAYS the already-committed
 *     secret (minting nothing), so a lost renewal reply is recovered by retrying
 *     the same (token, nonce) rather than by any overlap window — a superseded
 *     secret never stays valid and never yields a fresh primary without the
 *     initiator's nonce. This client gates on it: `maybeRenewNearExpiry`
 *     (multiplayerStore) only rotates proactively — and only then relies on
 *     same-nonce replay recovery — against a broker at or above
 *     MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_RECOVERABLE_ROTATION below. Additive, so
 *     MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL stays at 2: every older broker still
 *     parses every v9 frame (the nonce defaults away), and this client simply
 *     does not proactively rotate against one.
 * 8 — Tournament match structure. CreateTournament gains `match_type` (Bo1 /
 *     Bo3), optional (`#[serde(default)]`); `None` resolves to the arity default
 *     (Bo3 head-to-head, Bo1 for pods — single-game per MSTR), preserving pre-8
 *     behaviour. TournamentSummary gains the resolved `match_type`, server →
 *     client. This lets a 2-player event be Bo1 (e.g. single-game single
 *     elimination). Purely ADDITIVE, so MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL
 *     stays at 2 and no client-side floor is needed: a client's `match_type`
 *     reaching a pre-8 broker deserializes away (the event runs the default
 *     structure — a silent capability loss, not a parse error), and a pre-8
 *     broker's summary omitting it is inert against a `JSON.parse` client.
 * 7 — Tournament game-format label and an "automatic + N" round option. Two
 *     fields added to CreateTournament, both optional (`#[serde(default)]`):
 *     `format` (a GameFormat display label, mirroring the one a LobbyGame
 *     listing already carries) and `plus_rounds` (add N to the auto-derived
 *     round count — the "Swiss plus N" shape, mutually exclusive with
 *     `total_rounds`). Separately, the DIFFERENT TournamentSummary message
 *     gains a `format` echoed back resolved (server → client). Purely ADDITIVE
 *     in BOTH directions, so MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL below stays at
 *     2 and — unlike 6's scoring relaxation — NO client-side floor is needed:
 *     a client sending `format`/`plus_rounds` to a pre-7 broker has them
 *     ignored as unknown fields (a silent capability loss, not a parse error),
 *     and a pre-7 broker's summary omitting `format` is inert against this
 *     client, whose consumer is `JSON.parse`.
 * 6 — Broker-owned tournament action legality, broker-owned default scoring,
 *     and expiring/rotating tournament credentials. Two lobby variants added —
 *     RenewTournamentCredential and TournamentCredentialRenewed — which alone
 *     makes this bump mandatory. PairingView gains a required report_gate;
 *     TournamentSummary gains a required open_actions and a required resolved
 *     scoring; TournamentCreated and TournamentJoined each gain a required
 *     expires_at_ms beside the token they already carried. All of those are
 *     server → client, and this client ignores fields it does not name, so
 *     MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL below deliberately stays at 2 — a
 *     v2 broker still speaks everything this client already parses.
 *     CreateTournament.scoring is RELAXED from required to optional, `None`
 *     meaning "the broker applies its arity default". That direction is NOT
 *     symmetric: a client that omits scoring against a pre-6 broker gets a
 *     hard `missing field` parse error, not a degrade. It is gated on the
 *     CLIENT side by MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_DEFAULT_SCORING below — capability,
 *     not parseability, exactly as 5 gated the ack — so a below-floor session
 *     keeps sending an explicit policy instead of being evicted.
 * 5 — Request-correlated settlement for the four GATED tournament actions.
 *     Two LobbyServerMessage variants added — TournamentActionAck and
 *     TournamentActionRejected — which is what makes this bump mandatory. Both
 *     are requester-only point replies carrying the client-minted request_id,
 *     so a caller can tell its own outcome from an ambient TournamentUpdate for
 *     the same tournament. StartTournamentRound, ReportMatchResult,
 *     DropFromTournament and EndTournament each gain one optional request_id.
 *     Purely ADDITIVE in both directions — an omitted correlator deserializes
 *     to None and a present one is ignored by a v4 broker — so
 *     MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL below deliberately stays at 2.
 *     Capability, not parseability, is what moves here: a pre-5 broker cannot
 *     ANSWER a correlated action, which is what
 *     MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_TOURNAMENT_ACK below exists to gate — separately,
 *     and without evicting the session.
 * 4 — The tournament-organizer message set: seven LobbyClientMessage variants
 *     and five LobbyServerMessage variants. Purely ADDITIVE, so
 *     MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL below deliberately stays at 2 — no
 *     existing variant changed shape, so nothing this client already parses
 *     can break against a version-2 broker.
 * 3 — FormatConfig gained default_deck_copy_limit (see PROTOCOL_VERSION 50
 *     above for the full entry). Same three carriers as 2:
 *     CreateGameWithSettings, JoinTargetInfo, PeerInfo. Unlike 2, this is a
 *     CAPABILITY bump, not a parse bump — the field is serde-optional and
 *     still deserializes cleanly on either side — so
 *     MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_LOBBY_PROTOCOL below does NOT move: a v2 broker
 *     can still create/join a game, it just can't declare or observe a
 *     non-default deck-copy-limit override, silently getting the fail-closed
 *     UpTo(1) fallback instead of the format's real default.
 * 2 — FormatConfig.deck_size retyped from a bare integer to the adjacently
 *     tagged DeckSizeRule, carried by CreateGameWithSettings, JoinTargetInfo
 *     and PeerInfo. See LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION in
 *     crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs for what the floor move evicts.
 * 1 — Initial lobby-owned version, covering the lobby variant set unchanged
 *     since #1880.

    // its reconnect grace period is effectively unbounded and sessions are
    // never stale-purged; a transient drop against a live sidecar is exactly
    // the recoverable case, and 8 attempts is the same budget `online` gets.

    // `reconnecting` UI before `reconnectFailed`, where today it fails

    // That is a floor, not a ceiling. It assumes each connect is *refused*
    // immediately. If they hang instead, `attachSocket` calls
    // `openPhaseSocket` without a `timeoutMs`, taking its 5000ms default, so
    // the worst case is 32 + 8x5 = 72s.

    // Still the right trade — the common case goes from fatal to recovered —
