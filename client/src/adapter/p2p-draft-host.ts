   * broadcasts unconditionally rather than only at a round boundary.

   * where a seat the engine itself marks `is_bot` gets the evaluated turn.
   *
   * Seat 0's view suffices for every field read here: `active_seat`,

   * public). Only `revealed` is viewer-scoped, and nothing here reads it —
   * which is the point, since reading the faces is what would make this an AI.
   *
   * `undefined` from the `find` is left as a no-op rather than a thrown error:
   * the engine's own invariant is that some decision is always legal for the
