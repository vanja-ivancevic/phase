/**
 * Passive overlay surfacing a multi-card top-of-library reveal to every player.
 *
 * CR 701.20b: revealed cards are public to all players. When an effect reveals
 * several top-of-library cards at once ("reveal the top N", or "look at the top
 * N, reveal any number" — e.g. Lead the Stampede), the engine publishes them to
 * `revealed_cards` for the duration of the choice and un-redacts them in every
 * viewer's filtered state. `LibraryPile` only renders the single top card, so
 * the cards past the first were otherwise invisible (issues #2366, #2005).
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the gap `LibraryPile` leaves: 2+ revealed cards that are
 * still in a library zone. A single persistently-revealed top card (Future
 * Sight, Oracle of Mul Daya) is already shown by `LibraryPile`; hand reveals
 * (Thoughtseize) are not top-of-library and are excluded by the library filter.
 * The overlay mounts below modals (z-30), so the choosing player's DigChoice
 * modal occludes it while watching players — who have no modal — see the reveal.
 *
 * CR 702.60a: Ripple also lands here — its top-N reveal stays in the library
 * (CR 701.20b) and is published to `revealed_cards` for the duration of the
 * same-named free-cast offer, so this strip persists behind `CascadeChoiceModal`
 * after `RippleRevealAnimation`'s transient fan has faded.
