 * milled — is rendered only as a direct read of a published engine schema/proposal/response-spec
 * field; the client never computes, scales or re-attributes one. The player's own DECLARATION is
 * the other side of that line: the count and its partition across published `choice_id`s are
 * authored, summed and displayed here for form state and button enablement, and the engine
 * validates it independently. `DeclareShortcut.template` is always `null`: constructing a
 * `DecisionTemplate` is not a client authority, and the engine remains the sole legality authority
 * (`predictability_gate` + `validate_pins`).
 *
 * MEASURED LIMIT, stated rather than assumed — `null` is what the client can honestly send,
 * NOT a payload the engine accepts everywhere. `handle_declare_shortcut`
 * (`game/engine.rs`, the `!offer.schema.points.is_empty()` block) REFUSES a `template: null`
 * declaration unless the proposer controls the recorded loop period. Carrying the engine's own
 * issued declaration through the manual declare path is an ENGINE-side repair; a client that
