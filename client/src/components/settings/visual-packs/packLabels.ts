 * code stays, uppercased, because it IS what the user typed to install the
 * pack and is the only part that distinguishes one printing pack from another.
 *
 * Unrecognised ids fall through to the raw value rather than to a placeholder.
 * `PackId`'s pattern admits exactly the five shapes below, so this is
 * unreachable through the brand — but the row it labels is an INSTALLED pack,
 * read back from a database written by an older version of this app, and a row
 * the panel cannot name must still be nameable to whoever is asked to remove
