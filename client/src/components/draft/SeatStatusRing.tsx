 * Which per-seat tally the badge shows.
 *
 * `"packs"` is the pick-and-pass reading: `active_pack_count` is the engine's
 * 0-or-1 presence signal for a booster a seat is holding right now. Under a
 * shared stack no seat ever holds a booster — the engine publishes 0 for every
 * seat by construction — so that badge would sit at zero for the whole draft
 * while the number a Winston player actually tracks goes unshown. `"drafted"`
 * is that number: how many cards the seat has taken, which is open information
 * at the table because everyone watches the piles move.
 *
 * A typed axis rather than a `boolean`, so a third reading (a sealed pool's
 * size, say) is a variant rather than a second flag.
