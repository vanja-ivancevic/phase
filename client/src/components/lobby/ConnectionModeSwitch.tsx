 * governed by it: `MultiplayerPage` routes a join on the shape of the code.

 * Buttons with `aria-pressed`, matching the incumbent button-based segmented
 * control (`components/draft/BotDifficultySelector`). `role="radio"` is

 * reads worse than a pressed-button group. The group carries its own
 * `aria-label`, so a surface may render a visible label beside it without
