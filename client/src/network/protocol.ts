/**
 * Wire-protocol version. Bumped whenever the binary wire format or the shape
 * of the first-contact messages (`game_setup` / `reconnect_ack`) changes in
 * a non-backward-compatible way. Carried on those two messages so a guest
 * connecting to a host running a different version can detect the mismatch
 * in-band and surface an actionable "refresh both windows" message instead
 * of silently corrupting state.
 *
 * A host → guest mismatch is enforced in exactly ONE place:
 * `P2PGuestAdapter.handleHostMessage` (`adapter/p2p-adapter.ts`).
 * `validateMessage` below deliberately does NOT check it. A throw from there
 * propagates out of `decodeWireMessage` into the `catch` in `peer.ts`, which
 * warns and drops the frame — so the host's `game_setup` never reaches the
 * adapter, the setup promise never settles and the guest hangs on the
 * connecting screen with no layer able to tell the user. Only the adapter
 * holds the state needed to perform the response.
 *
 * The guest → host direction has its own single site: current guests must stamp
 * this version on `guest_deck` / `reconnect`, and `P2PHostAdapter`'s
 * first-contact gate rejects a missing or unequal value before it allocates a
 * seat or adopts reconnect state.
 *
 * Bumps to date:
 *  60 — game_setup and state_update carry GameState, whose ability
 *       definitions and transient continuous effects can now hold the
 *       event-deadline `Duration::UntilEvent`, and whose transient effects
 *       carry duration_event_source. Both peers are browsers and neither
 *       validates the shape, so a v59 peer would take the new duration with
 *       no decode error; first contact rejects the skew instead. Bumped in
 *       lockstep with full-game protocol 78.
 *  59 — Prospective: no GameState shape change lands in this bump. Moved
 *       ahead of new GameFormat variants — the same precedent as 32's CommanderDraft variant: the
 *       break, when it lands, will be conditional on a new variant actually
 *       being serialized in a game_setup/state_update payload, not
 *       unconditional like FormatConfig.deck_size's 32 retype. First
 *       contact stays exact-match on both roles (guest `hostVersion !==
 *       WIRE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, host `guestVersion !== WIRE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`),
 *       so no older peer ever completes a pairing that could carry a v59
 *       payload.
 *  57 — game_setup and state_update carry GameState, whose paid resolution
 *       cleanup, receipt, and delayed-install origin now carry a
 *       producer-issued offer owner. A v56 peer cannot preserve cross-offer
 *       isolation across a paused offer, so first contact rejects the skew.
 *       Bumped in lockstep with full-game protocol 75.
 *  56 — game_setup and state_update carry GameState, whose
 *       ResolutionCastCleanup can now carry exact delayed-trigger receipts.
 *       A v55 peer cannot preserve the cancellation authority across a paused
 *       paid offer, so first contact rejects the skew. Bumped in lockstep with
 *       full-game protocol 74.
 *  54 — game_setup and state_update carry GameState, whose
 *       FreeCastWindow requires `ResolutionCastFacePolicy` instead of the
 *       legacy `filter`; WaitingFor.CastOffer { kind: GraveyardPaidCast } carries
 *       additional_cost and installed_triggers (both serde-additive) and opens
 *       for seven more printed cards that a v53 peer handled as a lingering
 *       permission. A v53 guest parses the offer and pays the wrong cost, so
 *       first contact rejects a v53 peer before state delivery. Bumped in
 *       lockstep with full-game protocol 72.
 *  53 — game_setup and state_update carry GameState, whose OutsideGameChoice
 *       for an opened booster pack now names a required origin: PackOrigin in
 *       place of set_code. First contact therefore rejects a v52 peer before
 *       state delivery. Bumped in lockstep with full-game protocol 70.
 *  52 — game_setup and state_update carry GameEvent[] and can now carry the
 *       tagged ExtraTurnCreated event. First contact therefore rejects a v51
 *       peer before state delivery. Bumped in lockstep with full-game protocol
 *       69.
 *  51 — PendingManaAbility.chosen_tappers changed from Vec<ObjectId> to
 *       Option<Vec<ObjectId>> (#8698), separating an ANSWERED zero-tapper
 *       CR 107.3a X-sentinel selection (X=0) from an unanswered one. A PARSE
 *       bump like 50: the field carries no serde default, so a pre-51 payload
 *       that omits it is a missing-field error rather than a silent None. The
 *       reverse direction is why first contact must refuse the skew — Some([])
 *       goes on the wire as `[]`, which a v50 build's is_empty() gate reads as
 *       *unanswered* and re-prompts forever. Since game_setup and
 *       reconnect_ack carry GameState, first contact rejects the skew instead.
 *       Bumped in lockstep with PROTOCOL_VERSION 68.
 *  50 — DerivedViews.dungeon_rooms entries gained required `card` and `rooms`
 *       fields: the dungeon card's Scryfall identity, and every room with its
 *       outgoing edges (CR 309.5a) and its position on the printed card face.
 *       A PARSE bump like 49, not a silent capability loss like 39: neither
 *       field carries a serde default, so a v49 peer cannot parse a snapshot
 *       in which anyone is venturing. Nor is the reverse benign — this client
 *       reads `card` unconditionally when resolving the dungeon art, so a v49
 *       host would throw in render rather than drop the panel. Since
 *       game_setup and reconnect_ack carry GameState, first contact rejects
 *       the skew instead of allowing either failure.
 *  49 — ReplacementCondition.FirstTokenCreationEachTurn moved its required
 *       player field to an optional active_player_req, and CopyTargetPurpose
 *       gained a CopyTokenSource variant. Both are one-way parse breaks: the
 *       condition's player field was REQUIRED through v48, so a v48 peer hits a
 *       missing-field error, and the purpose tag is internally tagged, so a v48
 *       peer hits an unknown-variant error on CopyTokenSource. Bumped in
 *       lockstep with PROTOCOL_VERSION 66.
 *  48 — Retroactive bump for two new-tag changes that landed without one.
 *       #8501 added Effect.OpenBoosterPack and the BoosterPack arms of
 *       OutsideGameChoiceSource / OutsideGameSelection (adjacently-tagged, so
 *       an old peer cannot decode them at all); #8332 added slots/slot_pools to
 *       WaitingFor.RetargetChoice and controller to StackEntryDisplay (optional,
 *       so an old peer decodes and then misrenders — RetargetChoiceModal
 *       indexes slot_pools, and its ?? guards an undefined element, not an
 *       undefined array, so an old host + new guest throws during render).
 *       No wire shape changes here; this exists so first contact stops admitting
 *       the skew. Bumped in lockstep with PROTOCOL_VERSION 64.
 *  47 — WaitingFor.ReplacementChoice gained an engine-owned
 *       ReplacementChoiceKind discriminator and a last_applied_decides flag.
 *       Both are optional on the wire, so a skewed host/guest pair decodes
 *       successfully and then misrenders the prompt instead of failing at
 *       first contact.
 *  45 — Effect.ChooseCounterKind gained domain and chooser, carried inside
 *       GameObject.abilities and trigger definitions on every GameState frame
 *       (CR 608.2d). Additive behind serde defaults; a v44 peer has no field to
 *       receive the printed list or the random chooser into and silently reads
 *       both as an on-target prompt, placing no counter. Since game_setup and
 *       reconnect_ack carry GameState, first contact rejects the version skew.
 *       Bumped in lockstep with PROTOCOL_VERSION 61.
 *  44 — DerivedViews.back_face_spell_costs publishes, for each card the viewer
 *       may cast whose player chooses a spell face at cast time (a split card
 *       such as a Room, a spell//spell MDFC — CR 709.3 + CR 712.11b), the live
 *       cost of the OTHER face; spellCosts reports the live face only. The
 *       cost badge renders both faces from this map. Additive behind a serde
 *       default, but this client renders the map directly; a v43 host would
 *       silently show a Room's single-face badge again, on top of the second
 *       half's printed cost. Since game_setup and reconnect_ack carry
 *       GameState, first contact rejects the version skew. Bumped in lockstep
 *       with PROTOCOL_VERSION 60.
 *  43 — LegalActionsWire.viewerInteraction's shortcut preview changed from a
 *       single optional InteractionShortcutPreview to an
 *       Array<InteractionShortcutPreview>, one element per offerable count,
 *       each element also carrying an allocation list for the declaration's
 *       shape over that count. Both peers on this track are browsers, so
 *       neither validates the shape: a v42 guest paired with a v43 host would
 *       read a list where its type says object and render the offer wrong, with
 *       no decode error anywhere. First-contact version equality is the only
 *       place the skew is refusable, and no shim ships. Bumped in lockstep with
 *       PROTOCOL_VERSION 59 in crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs, which the
 *       same retype breaks in the declared Rust types — but no production Rust
 *       code deserializes ServerMessage, so that track fails silently at the
 *       browser too, and the handshake is the only refusal point on both.
 *  42 — New guest → host `state_ack` frame, carrying the highest state
 *       revision the guest has actually APPLIED — the fact a host ledger that
 *       records TRANSMISSION cannot observe, since a send resolving true only
 *       means the bytes reached the channel. On the stale-drop branch of
 *       `state_update` it reports the NEWER revision the guest already holds,
 *       not the stale one it just discarded. The guest emits it and the host
 *       ADVANCES each seat's redelivery entry off it (the entry is still
 *       CREATED on an accepted handshake send, so a lost ack cannot disarm
 *       the sweep). A v41 peer would not carry `state_ack` in
 *       VALID_TYPES, so `validateMessage` would throw, the throw would
 *       propagate out of `decodeWireMessage` into `peer.ts`'s catch, and
 *       every ack would be dropped with a console warning — a capability
 *       loss, not a parse break of the surrounding session, though unlike 24
 *       it is a whole frame rejected rather than an accepted frame missing an
 *       additive field. Since
 *       game_setup and reconnect_ack carry the version, first contact rejects
 *       the skew rather than allowing that loss, so the drop path above is
 *       unreachable in practice; it is stated because it is what the
 *       handshake exists to prevent. That check lives in
 *       `P2PGuestAdapter.handleHostMessage`, not in `validateMessage` — see
 *       the paragraph above.
 *  40 — DerivedViews.room_half_identities publishes both halves of every
 *       battlefield Room in printed order, resolved through the COPIED halves
 *       for a permanent that copies a Room (CR 709.5b + CR 707.2). The unlock
 *       special action's offer names the half it would unlock and shows that
 *       half's cost (CR 709.5e) from this map: an enter-as-copy recipient
 *       carries neither on its own printed card (its `back_face` is empty and
 *       its printed name is its own), and printed order is engine work
 *       besides — `room::live_face_door` reads `modal_back_face`, the
 *       CR 709.5d mapping. Face-down permanents are absent (CR 708.2a). The
 *       field is additive behind a serde default, but this client renders the
 *       map directly rather than deriving halves from raw state; a v39 host
 *       would silently label every offered door "Tap for Mana" again, which is
 *       the defect this bump exists to fix. Since game_setup and reconnect_ack
 *       carry GameState, first contact rejects the version skew rather than
 *       allowing that capability loss.
 *  39 — DerivedViews.storm_count publishes the engine-owned number of copies a
 *       current Storm trigger will create, or a newly cast Storm spell would
 *       create. The field is additive, but this client renders the scalar
 *       directly; a v38 host would silently omit the Storm HUD status. Since
 *       game_setup and reconnect_ack carry GameState, first contact rejects
 *       the version skew rather than allowing that capability loss.
 *  38 — Casting permissions gained a typed lifetime. Two parts, with different
 *       compatibility consequences:
 *       (a) `CastingPermission::ExileWithAltAbilityCost` gained `duration`
 *           and `source_id`; `::ExileWithAltCost` gained `source_id` beside the
 *           `duration` it already carried. `source_id` is the granting
 *           permanent whose presence bounds the stated lifetime. Additive
 *           behind serde defaults, like entry 34's `prepared_copy_source`.
 *       (b) `Duration` gained the `WhileControllingHost` ("for as long as
 *           you control ~") and `WhileHostOnBattlefield` ("for as long as ~
 *           remains on the battlefield") variants (CR 611.2b). Each new tag
 *           is a PARSE BREAK in the v38 -> v37 direction, in the same shape
 *           as the full-game bump at entry 46 (new tag emitted, old peer
 *           cannot parse it; the break runs ONE way, unlike entry 32's
 *           two-way break): a v37 peer deserializing a snapshot that contains
 *           either new tag fails on an unknown variant. There is no serde
 *           default that can rescue it, which is why the handshake must
 *           refuse the pairing rather than degrade.
 *  37 — FormatConfig gained default_deck_copy_limit, the resolved per-format
 *       deck-copy ceiling (CR 100.2a / CR 100.2b / CR 903.5b) max_deck_copies
 *       and the deck-compatibility admission path now both read. The field
 *       is optional and still parses on an older peer, but silently falls
 *       back to the fail-closed UpTo(1) singleton cap instead of the
 *       format's real declared limit — a silent capability loss like 24, not
 *       a parse break. game_setup and reconnect_ack both carry the full
 *       GameState, so this P2P track is broken by the same change as the
 *       full-game PROTOCOL_VERSION track (see
 *       crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs entry 48) and must bump in
 *       lockstep with it.
 *  36 — Resolution-time optional fixed sacrifice payments add a typed
 *       replacement-resumable continuation to GameState.
 *  35 — QuantityRef.Aggregate and QuantityRef.TrackedSetAggregate were
 *       replaced in GameState snapshots by the canonical
 *       QuantityRef.PropertyAggregate tag with a validated source object. New
 *       peers migrate both legacy input tags, but a v34 peer cannot parse the
 *       canonical tag emitted by v35, so P2P first contact rejects the skew.
 *  34 — GameState gained serialized cast-occurrence provenance and prepared-copy links.
 *  33 — Resolution-time optional PayCost(OneOf) branch choice added a
 *       serialized WaitingFor/GameAction pair.
 *  32 — FormatConfig.deck_size changed from a bare u16 to the adjacently
 *       tagged DeckSizeRule enum (Minimum(u16) / Exactly(u16)), because
 *       CR 903.13f(1) makes Commander Draft a command-zone format with a
 *       minimum rather than an exact size, and GameFormat gained a
 *       CommanderDraft variant (CR 903.13a). A PARSE bump like 16, not a
 *       silent capability loss like 24: FormatConfig::deck_size carries
 *       neither a serde default nor a deserialize_with, so a v31 peer's
 *       "deck_size": 60 cannot deserialize against the adjacently tagged enum
 *       and a v32 peer's {"type":"Minimum","data":60} cannot deserialize
 *       against a v31 u16 — the break is unconditional, runs in BOTH
 *       directions, and hits every format's snapshot, not just Commander
 *       Draft's. GameState.format_config's serde default does NOT rescue it:
 *       a field-level default applies only when the key is ABSENT, and an old
 *       peer sends the key present with the old inner shape. The
 *       GameFormat::CommanderDraft variant is the second and narrower half —
 *       it breaks only when that variant is actually serialized.
 *  31 — Action and mana-payment-preview rejections carry engine-owned,
 *       viewer-filtered ActionRejection DTOs. First-contact versioning keeps
 *       legacy peers from treating a typed rejection as a transport string.
 *  30 — ManaRestriction.CannotCastSpellFromZone adds a serialized
 *       GameState/ManaUnit restriction used by Karolina Dean. Older peers
 *       cannot deserialize that externally tagged enum variant.
 *  29 — WaitingFor.ChooseObjectsSelection publishes min and optional max
 *       bounds. A v28 peer silently ignores the additive fields and offers
 *       out-of-range selections, so refuse the capability mismatch during
 *       host/guest first contact.
 *  28 — PayCostKind::TapCreatures changed from { aggregate } to a required
 *       { mode } (Fixed/VariableX/Aggregate) — the fix that also unlocks
 *       the u32::MAX X-sentinel tap-cost form (Glacian, Powerstone Engineer
 *       + 8 sibling cards, #7799). mode carries no serde default, so a
 *       GameState snapshot paused mid-TapCreatures payment under the old
 *       aggregate shape now fails to deserialize instead of risking a
 *       silent fixed/aggregate misclassification. game_setup and
 *       reconnect_ack both carry the full GameState, so this P2P track is
 *       broken by the same change as the full-game PROTOCOL_VERSION track
 *       (see crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs entry 37) and must bump
 *       in lockstep with it.
 *  27 — WaitingFor.ChooseDungeon.options changed from DungeonId[] to
 *       DungeonPreview[], and ChooseDungeonRoom dropped option_names, gained a
 *       required dungeon_name, and changed options from number[] to
 *       RoomPreview[], so each option carries the room's printed name and
 *       room-ability text (CR 309.4b-c). A PARSE bump like 16, not a silent
 *       capability loss like 24: none of the new fields carry a serde default,
 *       so a v26 peer cannot deserialize a dungeon-choice snapshot at all.
 *       DerivedViews.dungeon_rooms rides along in the same bump — it IS
 *       optional and would parse on a v26 peer, but this client deleted its
 *       dungeon_progress room-index derivation, so a v26 host would leave a
 *       v27 guest with no dungeon badge.
 *  26 — DerivedViews.current_target_kind publishes the engine's CR 115.1
 *       classification of the live target announcement. The field is optional
 *       and parses on a v24 peer, so the loss is silent: this client deleted
 *       inferTargetNoun, so a v24 host would leave a v25 guest naming no
 *       target at all. The handshake is the only place to refuse it.
 *  23 — WaitingFor::AlternativeCastChoice.alternative_additional_cost_description
 *       changed from a string to a typed Emerge-sacrifice descriptor. Older
 *       clients would receive an object where their modal expects display text.
 *  22 — LegalActionsWire.viewerInteraction carries attachmentViews: the engine's
 *       membership list for each host's attachment fan. It parses on a v21 peer
 *       as an empty map, so the loss is silent — a guest paired with a v21 host
 *       would simply find every attachment fan gone.
 *  21 — LegalActionsWire.viewerInteraction carries the loop-shortcut preview,
 *       and the state snapshot carries WaitingFor::LoopShortcut.declaration.
 *       Both are optional and parse on a v20 peer; the loss is silent, so the
 *       handshake is the only place the pairing can be refused.
 *  24 — DerivedViews.legend_candidate_identities carries the engine-authored
 *       copy identity required to label legend-rule choices. The field is
 *       additive but the client no longer infers this identity from raw state,
 *       so accepting a v23 peer would silently remove every choice option.
 *  20 — Serialized player-action completion provenance and modal continuations.
 *  19 — Added an action_noop acknowledgement for accepted transport no-ops.
 *  18 — DebugCardEntries added a serialized, private resolution frame for
 *       multi-card sandbox battlefield entries that pause for replacement or
 *       as-enters choices. Old peers cannot deserialize that GameState shape.
 *  16 — PayableResource::ManaGeneric changed from { per_x } to
 *       { base_cost: ManaCost } (#6410) — a GameState payload field type
 *       change, and base_cost intentionally carries no serde default (a
 *       missing base_cost must fail deserialization, not silently resolve
 *       to a zero-cost payment), so old and new peers can't parse each
 *       other's serialized snapshots.
 *   1 — pre-compression JSON-serialization era (no longer in production)
 *   2 — gzip + version-prefixed binary wire format
 *   3 — Planechase state and action payloads in game_setup/reconnect snapshots
 *   4 — Archenemy derived view and scheme deck payloads
 *   5 — CardPredicateGuessMade game event shape
 *  13 — Actor-scoped priority-passing settings and filtered per-player state.
 *  17 — Sacrificial-mana source selection action and waiting-state snapshots.
 *  12 — Connive exact subject snapshots and resident paused post-replacement
 *       drains changed P2P GameState snapshots.
 *  11 — Serialized GameState trigger provenance and paused logical zone-change owners.
 *  10 — Dedicated companion deck slot and typed companion-reveal choices.
 *   9 — Meld pair and attacking-entry choices after mana-payment preview variants.
 *   8 — Mana-payment preview request/response variants.
 *   7 — PrecastCopyShortcut action and its two WaitingFor variants.
 *  17 — Bound draft-match concession request. A Traditional-draft guest
 *       asks its match authority to settle the match; it must not send a
 *       game-level concession through the ordinary P2P path.
 *   6 — Mulligan bottoming folded into a MulliganDecisionPhase::BottomCards
 *       sub-phase on WaitingFor::MulliganDecision; the MulliganBottomCards
 *       variant was removed
