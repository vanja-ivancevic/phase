   * cached instance is the one `useConcedeHandler` later receives. Measured,
   * not assumed: with `gameMode: "draft-match"` added to the mock's `getState`,
   * `getPlayerId()` still answered `0`; seeding the store returned by
   * `importActual` made it answer `2`. `multiplayerStore` is not mocked at all,
