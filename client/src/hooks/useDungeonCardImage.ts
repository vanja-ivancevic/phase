/**
 * Resolve the printed dungeon card's image.
 *
 * This exists as its own hook rather than reusing `useCardImage` because a
 * dungeon is not a game object: it never enters the battlefield (CR 309.2b puts
 * it in the command zone), so there is no `GameObject` with a `printed_ref` to
 * feed that hook, and none of its machinery — visual packs, art-selection
 * chains, printing pickers, face-down backs, the failed-source ladder — has
 * anything to act on for a card that has exactly one relevant printing.
 *
 * Two lookup paths, because the five dungeons are not indexed uniformly by the
 * Scryfall sidecars (verified against the Scryfall API):
 *
 *   1. `scryfall-data.json` by `oracle_id`. Covers Lost Mine of Phandelver,
 *      Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Tomb of Annihilation and Baldur's Gate
 *      Wilderness, all `layout: "normal"`.
 *   2. `scryfall-token-images.json` by printing id. This is the ONLY path that
 *      resolves Undercity, which is printed as the double-faced
 *      `Undercity // The Initiative`; `gen-scryfall-images.sh` lists
 *      `double_faced_token` in its NON_PLAYABLE exclusions, so Undercity is
 *      absent from the card table entirely.
 *
 * The engine hands over both ids (`DungeonCardView`), so this tries the card
 * table first and falls back to the token table without knowing which dungeon
 * is which — no per-dungeon special case reaches the display layer.
 *
 * The result is upgraded to the `large` rung (672x936, vs `normal`'s 488x680).
 * These cards are floor plans with room names and rules text printed inside
 * each room, so the extra resolution is legibility, not polish.
