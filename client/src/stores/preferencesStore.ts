      // v2 → v3: combatPacingMultiplier folded into a per-category
      //          pacingMultipliers map. The old combat value seeds
      //          pacingMultipliers.combat so existing users keep their
      //          combat slider exactly where they left it; other
      //          categories start at the neutral 1.0 default.
      // v3 → v4: AI deck selections become stable catalog IDs instead
      //          of display names.
      // v4 → v5: Add artStrategy and artOverrides for card art preferences.
      // v5 → v6: Replace artStrategy (single enum) with artChain (ordered preference list).
      // v6 → v7: Add aiBracketFilter; legacy stores default to empty (filter off).
      // v7 → v8: Add spellPaymentMode; legacy stores keep default auto.
      // v8 → v9: Add language; legacy/invalid values fall back to the
      //          browser-detected default so existing users keep their locale.
      // v9 → v10: Add stackDockSide; legacy stores default to right (the prior
      //          fixed behavior).
      // v12 → v13: Add cardPreviewMode; legacy stores default to "follow" (the
      //          prior fixed cursor-following behavior) via the shallow merge.
      // v13 → v14: Add cardPreviewHoverDelayMs; legacy stores default to 0
      //          (instant — the prior behavior) via the shallow merge.
      // v14 → v15: Add commandZoneDisplay; legacy stores default to "auto"
      //          via the shallow merge.
      // v15 → v16: Add flexLayout; legacy stores default to defaultFlexLayout()
      //          via the shallow merge. The default bands reproduce today's
      //          gridTemplateRows exactly, so this is a zero-regression seed —
      //          no explicit migration block needed.
      // v16 → v17: Add collapsedFolderIds; legacy stores default to [] (nothing
      //          collapsed — the prior behavior) via the shallow merge.
      // v17 → v18: Add lastSeenChangelogId; legacy stores default to undefined
      //          via the shallow merge. The changelog hook then silently seeds
      //          it to the current latest on first load, so existing users get
      //          no unread dot for entries that predate this upgrade.
      // v18 → v19: Add handSort; legacy stores default to "none" (insertion
      //          order — the prior hand behavior) via the shallow merge.
      // v19 → v20: Add collapseLands/collapseSupport; legacy stores default to
      //          "auto" (the prior threshold-driven collapse) via the shallow
      //          merge, so existing users see no behavior change.
      // v20 → v21: Add multiplayerBoardLayout; legacy stores are pinned to
      //          "focused", preserving the layout they were already playing on.
      //          Load-bearing now that the fresh-store default is "auto": this
      //          block is what keeps the new default a NEW-user default rather
      //          than a layout swap under existing players.
      // v21 → v22: Add telemetryEnabled; legacy stores default to `true` (opt-out,
      //          identity-free crash & usage telemetry) via the shallow merge —
      //          no explicit migration block needed (see flexLayout precedent).
      // v22 → v23: phaseStops gained a turn-direction scope; each legacy bare
      //          Phase string maps to a scoped stop defaulting to "AllTurns"
      //          (fire on every turn = the old behavior).
      // v23 → v24: Add dismissedReportCardNudge; legacy stores default to `false`
      //          (nudge not yet dismissed) via the shallow merge — no explicit
      //          migration block needed (see telemetryEnabled precedent).
      // v24 → v25: Add priorityPassingMode. Standard preserves the prior
      //          recommendation behavior; invalid persisted values normalize
      //          to Standard rather than enabling the experimental mode.
      // v25 → v26: Rename the experimental Smart value to the behavior it
      //          actually enables: SkipLowUseWindows.
      // v26 → v27: Add nativeEngineEnabled; the default-state shallow merge
      //             preserves the intended enabled-by-default behavior.
      // v27 → v28: Add showCardPreviewFooter; legacy stores default to true
      //          via the shallow merge, preserving the prior presentation.
      // v28 → v29: Add the sacrificial-mana-aware automatic mode. Existing
      //          values remain valid; malformed persisted values normalize to
      //          the legacy automatic behavior below.
      // v29 → v30: Add draftCardPreviewMode; legacy stores default to "none"
      //          via the shallow merge.
      // v30 → v31: Add draftDoubleClickConfirmPick; legacy stores default to
      //          true via the shallow merge.
      // v31 → v32: Add dismissedStatusId; legacy stores default to undefined
      //          via the shallow merge, so no operator status message counts as
      //          already dismissed for an existing user.
      // v32 → v33: Add logDockSide; existing and malformed stores reset to the
      //          prior fixed-right behavior.
      // v33 → v34: Replace the configurable logDefaultState with logPanelLastChoice
      //          — the game log now simply remembers how the user last left it and
      //          there is no Gameplay control for it. Every existing store adopts
      //          "open": for almost every store the old "closed" was the un-chosen
      //          default rather than a deliberate choice, and closing the panel
      //          once is now remembered. The legacy key is dropped so it cannot
      //          linger in the persisted blob. Mobile never auto-opens regardless,
      //          so this is a desktop-only behavior change.
      // v34 → v35: Add experimentalTournamentsEnabled. Existing users retain
      //          the hidden-by-default navigation because the shallow merge
      //          supplies false.
