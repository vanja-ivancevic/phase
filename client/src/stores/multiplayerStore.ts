 *
 * The grounds are OR-ed rather than counted separately because broker-side

 * `SubscribeLobby` inserts this connection's sender into one delivery set
 * (`AddSubscriber`) and `UnsubscribeLobby` removes it (`RemoveSubscriber`), so

 * many subscribes preceded it. On a channel both kinds ride, the last

 * `add`/`delete` are idempotent, so a double-subscribe cannot inflate the

/**
 * Single authority for token-gated tournament RPCs. Resolves the required
 * authority for `code` and refuses locally when it is absent — before any
 * socket is opened, so a call with no credential costs nothing and puts
 * nothing on the wire.
 *
 * Call sites never read `tournamentCredentials` themselves: a caller that
 * inspects which token an action needs is one refactor away from sending the
 * wrong tournament's token, and a caller that re-reads the map to explain a
 * failure has become a second authority that can disagree with this one (the
 * fan-out deletes entries asynchronously).
 *
 * Two distinguishable failure shapes, deliberately:
 *  - `{reason: "not_authorized", role}` — decided HERE, from this store's own
 *    map, with certainty. Nothing was sent.
 *  - any `TournamentRpcFailureReason` — decided by the transport or the
 *    broker. `"rejected"` IS now a reliable "the server refused me" signal: the
 *    four gated RPCs carry a `request_id` and settle only on a
 *    `TournamentActionRejected` echoing this caller's own correlator
 *    (`services/tournamentClient.ts`, module header part 4).
 *
 * Caution for consumers, in its corrected form: the reason a gated `{ok:false}`
 * still must not be read as "the action did not happen" is `"unsupported"`.
 * Against a broker below `MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_TOURNAMENT_ACK` the frame is
 * sent and the broker very likely performs the action — this client just cannot
 * confirm it. The other four wire reasons keep their existing meanings exactly.
 * Nothing in this store mutates state on a gated failure, now as a layering
 * choice (the fan-out owns state, this function owns the call) rather than as
 * compensation for a signal that could not be trusted.

      // the official lobby to its configured default while preserving explicit
      // custom/self-hosted addresses.
      //
      // v2 → v3: same rule, re-applied because the official set now spans a
      // broker PER RELEASE CHANNEL. Without this bump a returning preview
      // browser keeps its persisted production address, and detectServerUrl
      // honours any valid stored address, so it would silently stay pinned to a
      // lobby its build cannot handshake with. Re-running the same migration
      // repoints it at this channel's broker; a user-typed non-official address
      // is still preserved.
      //
      // v3 → v4: the host-setup selector dropped its standalone "On"
      // loop-detection choice. A `lastHostConfig.loopDetection` of `{ type:
      // "On" }` persisted under an older build is forwarded to `Interactive`
      // (its surviving semantics) rather than left to silently fall back to
      // `Off` on next read.
      //
      // v4 → v5: persisted host configurations used to retain a serialized
      // `FormatConfig`. Project it onto the current engine registry while
      // retaining only user-editable fields, so engine protocol shape changes
      // (such as `deck_size: 100` becoming `{ type: "Exactly", data: 100 }`)
      // cannot leave hosting stuck before GameCreated.
      //
      // v5 → v6: the single `serverAddress` splits into `hostingServer` (where
      // this client hosts and registers) and `userLobbySources` (the
      // authorities it browses). A hand-typed address becomes both; an
      // official or build-default address is already derived as a preset, so
