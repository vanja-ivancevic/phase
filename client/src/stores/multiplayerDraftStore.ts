/**
 * Zustand store for multiplayer P2P draft state.
 *
 * Separate from `draftStore` (Quick Draft, single-player) because the
 * multiplayer draft lifecycle is fundamentally different:
 * - Host/guest asymmetry (host runs WASM, guest is stateless receiver)
 * - Lobby phase with seat management before draft starts
 * - Network events (disconnect, reconnect, kick, pause/resume)
 * - Pairing and match handoff after deckbuilding
 *
 * The store wraps `DraftPodHostAdapter` or `DraftPodGuestAdapter` and
 * projects their events into reactive Zustand state for the React UI.

 *
 * Two jobs. It is the in-flight guard for `launchCommanderGame`. The button's
 * own `disabled` (`DraftPodPage`'s `launchDisabled`) cannot do that job alone:
 * it keys on `commanderLaunch`, which is not written until the host's own

 *
 * `adapter` is NULLABLE because the slot is claimed BEFORE the adapter exists.
 * It has to be: `hostRoom` does real PeerJS signalling, hundreds of
 * milliseconds to seconds, and a guard that only takes effect after the
 * constructor lets a second press through that whole window — opening a second
 * room and a second adapter, sending every live seat a second launch, and
 * leaking the first adapter. Claiming the slot first also makes that window
 * CANCELLABLE, which is what `cancelCommanderLaunch` acts on.
 *
 * `AbortController` rather than a stored reject callback, because the catch arm
 * has to tell a CANCEL apart from a FAILURE: a failure banners and disposes, a
 * cancel does neither (`cancelCommanderLaunch` owns teardown through
 * `terminateGame()`, which flushes `host_left` before closing — `dispose()`

/**
 * One whole shared-stack turn decision.
 *
 * A SIBLING of `performPick`, deliberately, and it must stay one — do not
 * "simplify" it back into `performPick`. `performPick` acknowledges on
 * `exactAddedIds`: every requested instance id present exactly once in the
 * pool afterwards. A shared-stack DECLINE adds ZERO cards to the pool and
 * names no ids at all, so that predicate can never be satisfied, and
 * `performPick` refuses a zero-length id list outright before it gets that
 * far. The engine publishes `shared_stack.decisions` for precisely this
 * reason: it is a monotone counter of APPLIED decisions, so
 * `after > before` acknowledges a decline and a take alike.
 *
 * Everything else is `performPick`'s machinery unchanged — the
 * `exclusivePickToken` mutual exclusion, the `lifecycleGeneration` /
 * adapter-identity `isFresh` guard, and `installWorkspace`. The one further
 * difference: reconciliation is `reconcileWorkspaceState` ALONE, with no
 * `applyDestination`. A decision names no cards, so there is no instance to
 * place into a workspace zone; a take's new pool cards are picked up by
 * reconciliation as unplaced, exactly as a restored pool is.
 *
 * Legality is not consulted here. The engine publishes a per-pile, per-decision
 * `legality` vector and refuses an illegal decision in the reducer; a client
 * that re-derived "may this seat take pile 2" from pile sizes would be a second
 * authority, which Fork 4 forbids.

/**
 * Single authority for how long a pod error lives.
 *
 * An error belongs to the phase it was raised in; a *change* of phase retires
 * it. Wrapping the store's setter — rather than writing `error: null` into each
 * success arm — gives one rule for both roles: guests write `phase` from many
 * arms of `handleGuestEvent` and cleared it at none, while the host had a
 * single ad-hoc supersession on `pairingsGenerated`.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and neither is incidental:
 *
 * - It fires only when `phase` actually *changes*. `viewUpdated` writes `phase`
 *   on every broadcast — a pick, a seat connecting, a seat dropping — so clearing
 *   on the mere presence of the key would erase an error the user has not read.
 *   That form was considered and rejected when this banner was introduced.
 * - The incoming payload wins. `kicked` and `hostLeft` write `phase` and `error`
 *   in one `set()`; spreading the payload last preserves the reason they carry.
 *
 * Not covered, deliberately: a retry that does not change phase — `startMatch`
 * fails and succeeds while `phase` is already `matchInProgress`. Dismissal
 * (`clearError`) remains the clearing path for that case.
 *
 * The Bo3 intergame window is no longer a phase at all — it is derived by
 * `draftPodScreen` from (`phase`, `sideboardPrompt`), and the three enter sites
 * (`handleBetweenGamesPrompt` and the two `bo3SideboardPrompt` arms) write no
 * `phase`. Three consequences for this rule, all intended:
 *
 * - Entering the window is not a transition, so an unread error survives it.
 * - Neither is any `viewUpdated`/`statusChanged`/`draftStarted` broadcast
 *   *during* the window: the phase is already `matchInProgress`, so a seat
 *   dropping mid-window no longer retires the banner. That narrowing was this
 *   block's own complaint and is now gone.
 * - Nor is the Bo3 game *boundary*: `bo3GameStarted` and the two `bo3GameStart`
 *   arms write `phase: "matchInProgress"` into a state whose phase is already
 *   `matchInProgress`, so the equal-phase short-circuit below returns `next`
 *   unchanged. An error raised earlier in the match therefore rides into game 2
 *   until the pod phase actually moves. This is a deliberate delta, not a bug;
 *   `clearError` remains the user's dismissal path.
 *
 * Scope: this wraps the *initializer's* setter, so it covers every write made
 * inside this module. It is not zustand middleware and does not rebind
 * `api.setState`, so `useMultiplayerDraftStore.setState(…)` bypasses the rule.
 * That is fine today — production has no such call site (only tests do) — but a
 * future production write through `setState` would not be phase-scoped.
