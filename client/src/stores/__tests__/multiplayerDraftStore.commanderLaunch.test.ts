/**
 * The Commander pod's launch, join and cancel, through the REAL store actions.
 *
 * After step 3a-ii this action hosts a real N-player P2P game instead of
 * navigating to `?mode=ai`, so the whole transport has to be faked rather than
 * merely stubbed: the action does `await import("../network/connection")` and
 * calls the real `hostRoom` (which opens a PeerJS `Peer`), then parks on
 * `await roomFull`. Four modules are mocked and each one is load-bearing:
 *
 *  - `../../network/connection` — otherwise every case opens a real peer;
 *  - `../../adapter/p2p-adapter` — otherwise there is nothing to emit
 *    `roomFull` and every case hangs past the vitest timeout;
 *  - `../../game/controllers/gameLoopController` and a `getSnapshot` on the
 *    fake — `installMatchRuntime` calls `adapter.getSnapshot()`, then the REAL
 *    `useGameStore.commitEngineSnapshot`, then `createGameLoopController`, so
 *    without both the end-to-end case dies inside the runtime install rather
 *    than at its assertion.
 *
 * The fake `P2PHostAdapter`'s CONTRACT is part of this suite's discriminating
 * power. It emits `roomFull` from inside `applySeatMutation`, to whatever
 * listeners are registered at that moment, once no waiting seat is left. That
 * MIRRORS the real adapter's ORDERING without matching its mechanism: the real
 * emit runs inside `enqueuePregameOp` and is technically async, but it is the
 * op's last statement and so resolves before the caller's `await` returns
 * (`p2p-adapter.ts`, end of the `applySeatMutation` body, guarded by
 * `firstWaitingSeat() === null`). A fake shaped like the `multiplayerStore`
 * precedent (`onEvent: vi.fn()`) never emits and hangs whether or not the
 * ordering is right; a fake the test pokes by hand passes whether or not the
 * ordering is right. Only an emit driven by the mutation discriminates.
 *
 * The real adapter has a SECOND `roomFull` emit in its guest-connection
 * handler, for a joining human filling the last seat. No case here can reach
 * it, so the fake models only the mutation one.
 *
 * The PURE RE-EMIT of the `draftPodHostAdapter` forwarding case is NOT pinned
 * here — this suite replaces `DraftPodHostAdapter` with a mock, so an event
 * driven through that mock's captured listener lands straight in
 * `handleHostEvent` and skips the real forwarding case entirely. That
 * assertion lives on the real adapter, in
 * `client/src/adapter/__tests__/draftPodAdapter.test.ts`.
 *
 * The GUEST half is mocked one layer DEEPER, and deliberately so: the pod
 * adapter (`DraftPodGuestAdapter`) is REAL and only `P2PDraftGuest` beneath it
 * is faked, so a launch driven through the captured wire listener travels the
 * adapter's own forwarding case before it reaches `handleGuestEvent`. Mocking
 * the pod adapter, as the host half must, would skip exactly the arm whose
 * absence stranded the pod's guests. The game-side `P2PGuestAdapter` fake
 * carries only the surface `joinCommanderGame` calls — notably no
 * `startPregameGame` and no `terminateGame`, which are host methods.
