 * The engine-authored legal set for a prompt the player answers with ONE

 * targets are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect."
 *
 * Returns `null` when `waitingFor` is not such a prompt, so a caller can tell
 * "no click-targeting is in progress" from "click-targeting is in progress and
 * nothing is legal yet". Same applicable-or-not convention as
 * `getBoardChoiceView`, which `DialogHost` consumes as `!= null`.
 *
 * Membership needs BOTH halves; do not widen on either alone:
 *   1. the engine has a `GameAction::ChooseTarget` apply arm for the variant, and
 *   2. its legal-set field is typed `TargetRef[]`, so it can name a player.
 *
 * The other `ChooseTarget` variants carry `ObjectId[]` and therefore cannot name
 * a player — `CopyTargetChoice.valid_targets`, `ExploreChoice.choosable`,
 * `PopulateChoice.valid_tokens` (the engine's populate arm matches
 * `TargetRef::Object` outright). They stay in `getWaitingForObjectChoiceIds`.
 *
 * Prompts answered by a DIFFERENT action are dialog-only by design and stay out.
 * Each already renders its player rows in its own modal, so nothing is
 * unreachable — only the click path differs:
 *   - `DistributeAmong`   -> `DistributeAmong { distribution }`; a click carries
 *                            no amount (DistributeAmongModal).
 *   - `ProliferateChoice` -> `SelectTargets`; CR 701.34a chooses any-size subset
 *     `TimeTravelChoice`     of permanents and/or players (ProliferateModal).
 *     `ChooseObjectsSelection`
 *   - `EachPlayerCopyChosenSelection` -> `SelectTargets`, ORDERED (first pick is
 *                            copied, second scales); a click carries no order.
 *   - `ChooseOneOfBranch` -> `ChooseBranch { index }`; `parent_targets` is
 *                            continuation context the modal never reads.
 * All of the above are host-wrapped (absent from
 * `DialogHost.CLICK_THROUGH_WAITING_FOR_TYPES`), so a HUD glow beneath their
 * `fixed inset-0` host could not be clicked even if it were offered.
 *
 * NOTE: `getWaitingForObjectChoiceIds` below keeps its own switch over a
 * superset of these arms. The two must agree on every shared arm, and neither
 * may silently gain an arm the other lacks. `PARTITION_FIXTURES` in
 * `gameStateView.test.ts` is a `Record<WaitingFor["type"], …>`, so adding a
 * variant to `WaitingFor` fails `pnpm run type-check` until that map records
 * what the player axis does with it. Apply the two-criteria test above before
 * answering that compile error.
