/**
 * Tournament-organizer RPCs and broadcast subscription over a **borrowed**
 * `PhaseSocket`. Five properties of this module are deliberate and load-bearing;
 * each is pinned by a test in `__tests__/tournamentClient.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## 1. This module owns no socket
 *
 * Every function here takes an already-open socket as its first parameter and
 * leaves its lifetime alone: nothing here opens one, and nothing here shuts one
 * down on any path — the borrowed socket's owner does that. `openPhaseSocket`
 * is imported for the `PhaseSocket` type alone, never invoked. Socket
 * acquisition, credential storage and reconnect handling all belong to
 * `stores/multiplayerStore.ts`.
 *
 * ## 2. This module owns no subscription
 *
 * {@link subscribeTournamentsOver} sends neither `SubscribeLobby` nor
 * `UnsubscribeLobby` — it sends nothing at all, ever. That is a deliberate
 * departure from `subscribeLobbyOver` in `brokerClient.ts`, which does send
 * both frames from its attach and its detach.
 *
 * The reason is that broker-side those two frames are not per-subscriber, they
 * are per-connection: `SubscribeLobby` inserts this connection's sender into one
 * delivery set (`AddSubscriber`) and `UnsubscribeLobby` removes it
 * (`RemoveSubscriber`, `crates/lobby-broker/src/broker.rs:317-343`), so a single
 * removal kills every tournament subscription riding the same socket no matter
 * how many subscribes preceded it. One reference count spanning both lobby and
 * tournament subscribers is therefore the only correct model, and that count
 * lives with the socket's owner in `multiplayerStore.ts`. If this module sent
 * the frames, they would sit outside the count that has to govern them.
 *
 * ## 3. Four of the seven RPCs get no `TournamentUpdate` point reply
 *
 * `StartTournamentRound`, `ReportMatchResult`, `DropFromTournament` and
 * `EndTournament` still produce no `ToSelf` `TournamentUpdate` on success — for
 * these four that frame is only ever a `ToSubscribers` broadcast
 * (`crates/lobby-broker/src/broker.rs`). What they do produce, as of lobby
 * protocol 5, is a `TournamentActionAck` addressed to the requester and
 * carrying that request's own correlator, so **a correlated caller observes its
 * own success without holding a subscription**. An uncorrelated caller — a
 * pre-correlation client, or a request this module declined to correlate
 * because the peer is too old (part 4) — still sees the old behavior: no point
 * reply, and success observable only on the ambient broadcast. Only
 * `CreateTournament`, `JoinTournament` and `GetTournament` have a point reply
 * that predates the correlator.
 *
 * ## 4. `TournamentUpdate` is a broadcast; the ack is what answers a request
 *
 * `TournamentUpdate` is emitted `ToSelf` from exactly one place —
 * `handle_get_tournament` — and `ToSubscribers` from `handle_join_tournament`,
 * from all four gated handlers' settlement, and from `reap_expired`'s
 * `Abandoned` arm. The frames are byte-identical in shape; the wire carries no
 * request-vs-broadcast discriminator beyond `code`.
 *
 * That is precisely why the four gated helpers no longer settle on it. While
 * one of them was in flight, **any** other actor's action on the same
 * tournament — including this same caller's own concurrent
 * {@link getTournamentOver}, whose `ToSelf` reply is wire-identical to a
 * foreign broadcast — produced a frame that matched a tag + code filter and
 * settled the promise `{ok: true}` with *that* view, ahead of the caller's own
 * outcome; a later refusal for the request that actually failed then arrived
 * with no listener left.
 *
 * The fix is on the wire rather than here, and that is the point: every
 * candidate client-only fix (a sequence number the broker does not echo, timing
 * heuristics, view diffing) would have fabricated provenance the broker never
 * sent. The broker now sends it. Each gated helper mints a `request_id`, puts
 * it on the request, and settles on the `TournamentActionAck` /
 * `TournamentActionRejected` carrying that same id — see {@link matchAck} — so
 * a correlated `{ok: true}` is this caller's own success and a correlated
 * `{ok: false, reason: "rejected"}` is this caller's own refusal.
 *
 * Two consequences a caller must know:
 *
 * - A correlated request ignores a bare `Error` frame (part 5), and that gives
 *   up a deliberately-designed property. `reject_reply` in
 *   `lobby-worker/broker-wasm/src/lib.rs` answers a frame refused at the
 *   parse/validation boundary with an uncorrelated `Error` *specifically* so a
 *   pending RPC fails fast instead of waiting out its timeout. For these four
 *   actions that fast-fail no longer reaches the caller, which settles
 *   `"timeout"` instead. The trade is narrow rather than free: a frame that
 *   never parsed never carried our id, so no correlated answer to it can
 *   exist, and reaching that boundary at all takes a field-bounds violation on
 *   a payload the store builds from broker-minted values.
 * - Against a peer below `MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_TOURNAMENT_ACK` there is no
 *   ack to wait for. The frame is still sent — the broker performs the action —
 *   and the call settles `{ok: false, reason: "unsupported"}`, which says *not
 *   confirmed*, never *failed*.
 *
 * ## 5. The `Error` reply carries no correlator
 *
 * `LobbyServerMessage::Error { message, code? }`
 * (`crates/lobby-broker/src/protocol.rs`) has no tournament code — its optional
 * `code` is a `ServerErrorCode` *class*, not a tournament code, and is usually
 * absent. An `Error` frame therefore settles every **uncorrelated** RPC in
 * flight on this socket — the three helpers that keep {@link matchReply} —
 * exactly as `resolveGuestOver` already behaves for the same reason. The
 * server's message is passed through raw; classifying or translating it is the
 * caller's job.
 *
 * The four correlated helpers deliberately do not settle on it. An uncorrelated
 * `Error` provably belongs to *some* request on this socket but not provably to
 * ours, so settling on it would be the mirror image of the bug part 4 describes
 * — a false negative in place of a false positive — and timeout is the honest
 * settlement. This is one choice with part 4's disclosed fast-fail trade, seen
 * from the other side.
 *
 * Of the three uncorrelated helpers, {@link getTournamentOver} is the one still
 * exposed to a racing same-code broadcast, and that exposure stays **benign**:
 * the question it asks is `ToSelf`-shaped, so a foreign frame answers it
 * correctly.

/**
 * Why a tournament RPC did not produce a value. A closed union rather than a
 * boolean pair or a bare string: each member is a distinct thing a caller can
 * do something different about.
 *
 * - `rejected` — the broker refused this request: an `Error` frame for an
 *   uncorrelated helper, or a `TournamentActionRejected` carrying **this
 *   caller's own correlator** for a gated one. `message` is its text verbatim.
 *   For the gated four this is now a reliable "the server refused *me*" signal,
 *   which before the correlator it was not.
 * - `aborted` — the caller's `AbortSignal` fired (or was already aborted).
 * - `timeout` — no matching frame arrived within `timeoutMs`.
 * - `connection_lost` — the socket was not open, or closed while in flight.
 * - `unsupported` — this peer's lobby protocol predates correlated tournament
 *   settlement, so it cannot answer a gated action at all. **The frame was
 *   sent and the broker very likely performed the action**; this client simply
 *   cannot confirm it. Never read as "the action failed".
 *
 * `unsupported` belongs to this wire union rather than to a store-level refusal
 * on the *was-anything-sent* axis: something went out, and the predicate reads
 * a **broker-advertised** fact (`ServerHello`'s `lobby_protocol_version`,
 * surfaced as `PhaseSocket.serverInfo.lobbyProtocolVersion`). That is the
 * distinction this union actually draws — whose fact the predicate reads, not
 * who evaluated it, since three of the four incumbent members are evaluated
 * client-side too. A refusal reading a fact the client itself authored belongs
 * outside; see `TournamentNotAuthorized` in `stores/multiplayerStore.ts`.

 * is `Option<ScoringPolicy>` with `#[serde(default)]`, so a client omits it
 * (`scoring: null`) and reads the resolved value back off
 * `TournamentSummary.scoring`. The create form computes no default at all.
 *
 * This helper survives ONLY for the one direction that is not symmetric:
 * omitting `scoring` against a pre-v6 broker is a hard `missing field \`scoring\``
 * parse error, not a degrade, so below {@link MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_DEFAULT_SCORING}
 * the send path substitutes this explicit policy. It lives here, beside its sole
 * consumer, rather than in `pages/tournamentPageState.ts`: a value import from
 * that module would close the runtime cycle
 * `tournamentClient → tournamentPageState → multiplayerStore → tournamentClient`.
 *
 * Arity-dependent by design: a fixed 3/1/0 would silently give every pod
 * organizer MTR head-to-head scoring instead of MSTR pod scoring.

 * it carries no `request_id`), and its reply is a distinguishable point reply
 * naming the `code` and `role` it answers for.
 *
 * `role` is the WIRE spelling (`"Organizer"` / `"Player"`, capitalized), never
 * the store's lowercase display role — the broker rejects the lowercase form
 * with a serde unknown-variant error. The matcher binds on BOTH `code` and
 * `role`, because an organizer who also joined holds two authorities on one code
 * and could rotate both concurrently on one socket; a `code`-only filter would
 * let the other authority's reply settle this call with the wrong token.
 *
 * The presented `token` must still be accepted: the broker refuses rotation of
 * an already-expired credential (it extends nothing that has lapsed,
 * `crates/lobby-broker/src/tournament.rs`), so the caller renews from the client
 * clock BEFORE `expires_at_ms`, never after a rejection.
 *
 * `rotationNonce` is the client-minted, per-attempt nonce that makes a lost
 * reply recoverable under lobby protocol v9: a first attempt sends a fresh nonce
 * and the broker mints; a RETRY after an uncertain result re-sends the SAME
 * nonce with the SAME (possibly now-superseded) `token`, and the broker REPLAYS
 * the already-committed secret rather than minting a second one. Presenting a
 * superseded token WITHOUT the matching nonce is refused, which is what stops a
 * stolen superseded secret from becoming a fresh authority — so the caller must
 * hold the nonce stable across retries of the same rotation.
