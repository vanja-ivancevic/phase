 * that carries a `normal` URL also carries an `art_crop`, none carries

 * which is NOT measured here; a set of records skewed entirely onto one rung
 * would be overstated ~3.8x (all `small`) or understated ~1.6x (all `normal`).
 *
 * `printing` also contributes a set icon, which is not card art at all. One per
 * pack against tens of thousands of card images, so it is counted at the same
 * weight rather than modelled.
 *
 * `core` no longer fits that reasoning and is OVERSTATED here by roughly 20x:
 * it is a card back plus every finite mana-symbol SVG (~77 records), of which
 * none are card art and nearly all are 1-2 KB vectors — so a real ~230 KB
 * download is quoted at ~4.9 MB. Nothing refuses on this figure
