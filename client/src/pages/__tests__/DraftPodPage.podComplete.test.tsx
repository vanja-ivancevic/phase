/**
 * PF2 / U21 rows 4, 5 and row 3b's store-level companion — the pod reaches its
 * launch screen through the REAL production chain.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT `DraftPodPage.commanderLaunch.test.tsx`.
 * That suite mocks `../../adapter/draftPodHostAdapter` wholesale, which is
 * exactly the class these rows must run for real; `vi.mock` is hoisted and
 * FILE-scoped, so it cannot be un-mocked inside a `describe`. Hence a sibling
 * file. `commanderLaunch.test.tsx` keeps its mocks and its landed tests.
 *
 * THE VACUITY THESE ROWS EXIST TO AVOID. Hand-feeding the store
 * `allDecksSubmitted` then `viewUpdated({status:"Complete"})` CANNOT FAIL: the
 * store's `viewUpdated` arm already maps `Complete` -> `"complete"` correctly at
 * base, so (1) = (2) = `"complete"`. The defect U21 fixes is not the store's
 * mapping — it is that NO `viewUpdated` IS EMITTED AT ALL, because
 * `generatePairings()` throws before `broadcastViews()` runs. The discriminator
 * is the PRESENCE of the event, and only production can supply that. So the
 * event sequence here is produced by the real `P2PDraftHost` funnel and is
 * never hand-written.
 *
 * THE CHAIN, real end to end:
 *   hostDraft -> new DraftPodHostAdapter() -> adapter.initialize()
 *     -> new P2PDraftHost() -> host.initialize()
 *   submitDeck -> adapter.submitDeck -> host.submitHostDeck
 *     -> handleDeckSubmission -> THE GATE -> broadcastViews -> viewUpdated
 *     -> adapter.handleHostEvent -> setStatus + emit
 *     -> store handleHostEvent -> phase -> DraftPodPage's phase switch
 *
 * FOUR STUBBED SEAMS, AND NO OTHERS, on the host-assembly chain. "Only the wasm
 * boundary is stubbed" would be FALSE — `DraftPodHostAdapter.initialize()` also
 * opens a peer room, fetches the full card database over the network, and
 * touches IndexedDB:
 *   1. `../../adapter/draft-adapter` (importOriginal) — the wasm boundary. ONE
 *      module mock covers BOTH on-chain `new DraftAdapter()` sites, since
 *      `draftPodHostAdapter.ts` and `p2p-draft-host.ts` import from the same
 *      module and `vi.mock` is keyed on the resolved module. `importOriginal`
 *      is required, not stylistic: `p2p-draft-host.ts` also imports
 *      `EMPTY_DRAFT_POOL_GROUPS` from it and a bare object mock drops it.
 *   2. `../../network/connection` — `hostRoom`, a peer/room setup.
 *   3. `globalThis.fetch` — `__CARD_DATA_URL__` is a Vite `define`, so the
 *      card-data fetch at the CommanderDraft gate is a REAL network call.
 *   4. `../../services/draftPersistence` (importOriginal) — ONLY the two
 *      IndexedDB functions. `saveActiveDraftPod` / `loadActiveDraftPod` /
 *      `clearActiveDraftPod` stay REAL: they are plain `localStorage`, they
 *      work under the test DOM, and ROW 5'S ENTIRE SUBJECT IS WHAT THEY STORE.
 *      Mocking this module wholesale would delete row 5.
 *
 * Everything else runs for real: both `initialize()`s, `handleDeckSubmission`,
 * `broadcastViews`, both layers' `handleHostEvent`, and every status mapper.
 *
 * PROHIBITED IN THIS FILE, and neither prohibition is discharged by "a sibling
 * suite does it" — the siblings mock these BECAUSE they hand-feed the store on
 * purpose:
 *   - `../../stores/multiplayerDraftStore` (4 of the 5 sibling suites mock it).
 *     This store IS rows 4/5's subject.
 *   - `../../adapter/draftPodHostAdapter` (`commanderLaunch` mocks it). It
 *     replaces the class these rows must run for real.
 *
 * `MenuShell`'s stub body is LOAD-BEARING: it is the sole ANCESTOR of the phase
 * content (`DraftPodPage.tsx:956`, inside `<MenuShell>` at `:933-958`), so
 * `() => null` would render neither `PairingPhaseView` nor `CompleteView` and
 * would COLLAPSE row 4's (1) onto its (2). `ScreenChrome` and `HostControls`
 * are SIBLINGS of `MenuShell`, outside the asserted subtree, so `() => null` is
 * correct for those two. `<MemoryRouter>` is likewise a discriminator-preserver,
 * not a convenience: the page calls `useNavigate`/`useSearchParams` and
 * `CompleteView` calls `useNavigate()`, all of which throw outside a router —
 * on BOTH trees, which would collapse (1) onto (2) the same way.

// `draftPodHostAdapter.ts:220`'s `new DraftAdapter()` is transient (its return
