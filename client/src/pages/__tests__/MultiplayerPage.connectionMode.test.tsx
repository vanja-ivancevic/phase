 * fallback across a remount; the server-offline prompt flips the same switch
 * the user sees rather than routing around it; and arriving with no anchor
 * repairs it instead of leaving the lobby pointed at nothing. Harness shape
 * follows `MultiplayerPage.hostServer.test.tsx`: render the real page, stub
 * the children, keep the real store module.
 *
 * The switch is read off HOST SETUP, not the lobby: the transport configures a
 * game being created, so that is the only surface that renders it.
