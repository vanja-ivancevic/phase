/**
 * U15 — the Commander pod's launch affordance, end to end through the REAL
 * `multiplayerDraftStore` action.
 *
 * The store is deliberately NOT mocked. Every assertion here is about what
 * `launchCommanderGame` produces — the game it hosts, the decks it assembles
 * and the URL it lands on — so a mocked store would leave the whole subject
 * untested. Only the HOST ADAPTER and the TRANSPORT are mocked; `hostDraft` is
 * driven for real so the store's module-private `activeHostAdapter` is
 * installed the way production installs it.
 *
 * PORTED from the `?mode=ai` design. Step 3a-ii replaced the local-AI
 * navigation with a real N-player P2P host, so the URL no longer carries
 * `format`/`players`/`difficulty` and there is no staged
 * `phase:draft-deck:` sessionStorage blob at all. Each case below keeps its
 * claim and moves its assertion to where the value now lives — the
 * `P2PHostAdapter` constructor argument and the seat mutations.
 *
 * Four mocks, each load-bearing. `../../network/connection` and
 * `../../adapter/p2p-adapter`, because the rewritten launch calls the REAL
 * `hostRoom` (which opens a PeerJS `Peer`) and then parks on `await roomFull`.
 * A `getSnapshot` on the fake adapter and
 * `../../game/controllers/gameLoopController`, because `installMatchRuntime`
 * calls `adapter.getSnapshot()`, the REAL `useGameStore.commitEngineSnapshot`
 * and `createGameLoopController` before the launch can navigate. Without them
 * the cheapest way to green is to weaken the end-to-end assertion, which would
 * quietly delete the only test covering the whole host path.
 *
 * At base a completed Commander pod offers exactly one button, "Return to
 * Menu", and no `navigate` call exists to capture.
