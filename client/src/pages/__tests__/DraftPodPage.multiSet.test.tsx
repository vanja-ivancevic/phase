/**
 * The pod host's set selection, end to end through the page.
 *
 * The claim under test is the one a multi-set draft lives or dies on for
 * multiplayer: a host can arrange SEVERAL sets, in an order they choose, and
 * that order reaches the host boundary intact. Before multi-set pods, this page
 * pinned the selector to its single-set mode and kept only one code, so a pod
 * could not express a mixed pool at all — every assertion below fails against
 * that shape.
 *
 * The real `SetSelector` and the real `draftPodStore` render here; only the
 * transport (`multiplayerDraftStore`), the wasm adapter class, and persistence
 * are replaced, so the pack list the host builds is measured where it is
 * actually handed off.
