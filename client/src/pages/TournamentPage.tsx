 * re-enables the FIRST action's control while its request is still in flight
 * (click Start, then End: `busy` moves `"start"` → `"end"` and Start's button
 * becomes clickable again with its own request unanswered).
 *
 * The value is therefore read for two different jobs. `!== null` gates every
 * control; the equality test picks one control's in-flight LABEL, and only
 * that. Keeping the label kind-specific is what still tells the viewer which
 * action is running while all of them are held.

   * failure alerts, `run`'s `setBusy(null)` and `handleReport`'s
   * `setReporting(null)`. The fifth, the subscription effect's own

   * not "guard the writes that looked reachable": each of the four unguarded
   * ones found so far turned out to have a concrete repro against a successor
   * tournament's page. The counterpart is that the subscription effect resets
   * each of those same pieces of state on a `:code` change, so declining a
   * stale write here never strands anything.
   *
   * Assigned in the subscription effect rather than during render, and
   * deliberately immediately before the state resets there. That placement
   * covers the one window the guard alone cannot: a continuation landing
   * between the commit that changed `code` and that effect still passes the
   * guard, but its write is then cleared by the `setFailure(null)` reset
   * queued behind it — React flushes pending passive effects before starting
   * the next render, so the two updates apply in that order. That much is
   * reasoned from React's scheduling; what the tests measure is the guard's
   * own path, where the effect has already run.

    //     delivery set, which is per-connection, not per-subscriber
    //     (`multiplayerStore.ts`, `lobbySubscriptionRefCount`), and the new
