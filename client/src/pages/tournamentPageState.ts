/**
 * Pure view-model derivations for the tournament-organizer surface.
 *
 * This module is the single authority for every derivation the tournament
 * components need. It is pure: no React, no store runtime, no I/O, no clock.
 * It renders nothing and it *formats* only — it never re-sorts, re-ranks or
 * re-computes anything the broker already decided. Standings arrive
 * pre-ranked (`crates/lobby-broker/src/tournament.rs:905-935`), pairings
 * arrive in generation order, and arity/bracket legality is validated
 * server-side alone.
 *
 * **Every import here is `import type`, by design.** The store's runtime
 * touches `localStorage` through its persistence middleware; importing a
 * *value* from it drags that runtime into every consumer of this module.
 * Measured on this tree: a type-only import costs 14ms of import time, the
 * same import switched to a value import costs 925ms *and* materializes the
 * Node `--localstorage-file` hazard. `verbatimModuleSyntax` makes the erasure
 * a compiler guarantee, and a static source assertion in
 * `__tests__/tournamentPageState.test.ts` pins it.
 *
 * Three of the exports below (`outcomeLabelKey`, `isReportable`,
 * `decisiveGameWins`) are independent exhaustive walks over the same
 * `PairingOutcome` wire union, and `tiebreakCells` is a fourth over
 * `Tiebreaks`. Each terminates in a `const unreachable: never` binding rather
 * than a `default:` arm, so a fifth wire arm fails the build in every place
 * that must make a decision about it. Components never discriminate these
 * unions themselves; they call these functions. `failureLabel` is a further
 * exhaustive walk of the same form, over the failure-reason union rather than
 * a wire union.

/**
 * The BELOW-FLOOR FALLBACK for {@link isPairingReportable}: whether the broker
 * will accept a `ReportMatchResult` for this pairing, decided from the pairing
 * outcome ALONE. As of lobby protocol v6 the broker carries the answer on
 * `TournamentPairingView.report_gate`, and {@link isPairingReportable} consumes
 * that; this function is what it degrades to against a pre-v6 broker that emits
 * no `report_gate`. Kept, not deleted, for exactly that reason.
 *
 * It is deliberately status-BLIND — it cannot see whether the tournament is
 * still running — so it answers `true` for an already-`Reported` pairing on a
 * `Completed` event, the one case `report_gate`'s `TournamentNotRunning` arm
 * exists to refuse. That is an accepted limitation of the fallback, never the
 * preferred path: a v6 broker's `report_gate` is always consulted first.
 *
 * A *total* contract, not a validity judgement about a submission's
 * contents (which is `validate_match_result`'s alone, and is never
 * duplicated here).
 *
 * `TournamentMeta::report_result`
 * (`crates/lobby-broker/src/tournament.rs:1741-1753`) matches the pairing's
 * existing outcome and returns `Err` for two arms *before*
 * `validate_match_result` is ever reached (`:1754`):
 *   - `Bye`     (`:1742-1746`) — "is a bye and has no result to report"
 *   - `Forfeit` (`:1747-1751`) — "was resolved by forfeit and cannot be reported"
 * Both are production-reachable: byes come from `partition_round`'s ordinary
 * remainder handling (`:1323`) and forfeits from `drop_player`'s
 * auto-settlement of a pairing left with one active player (`:1828`).
 *
 * `Some(PairingOutcome::Reported(_)) | None => {}` (`:1752`) means an
 * ALREADY-REPORTED pairing may be reported AGAIN — a reported result is
 * overwritten at `:1755`, and correcting a mistyped tally is a legitimate
 * organizer action. This guard is therefore **arm-selective, not
 * "unresolved only"**: narrowing it to `outcome === null` would wrongly hide
 * a legal affordance.
 *
 * Predicate form (rather than a typed result) mirrors the broker's own
 * `TournamentStatus::is_terminal()` guard, called earlier in this same
 * function (`:1730`; `report_result` opens at `:1721`).
 *
 * This answers "can this pairing be reported by anyone", NOT "may this viewer
 * report it". Authorization is a separate, orthogonal guard on the caller's
 * side, and it is *three* conjuncts, mirroring the broker's own three
 * refusals for a report — `authorize_player`'s token and dropped checks
 * plus `handle_report_match_result`'s seat check
 * (`crates/lobby-broker/src/broker.rs`): {@link viewerRoles} — is this viewer
 * a player at all; {@link isActiveEntrant} — has that player not dropped; and

 * Whether `playerKey` names an entrant of `view` who has **not** dropped.
 *
 * This is the client-side mirror of the second conjunct `authorize_player`
 * enforces (`crates/lobby-broker/src/broker.rs`): a token that resolves to an
 * entrant is refused anyway once `player.dropped` is true
 * (`"Player has dropped from tournament {code}"`). Token possession —
 * {@link viewerRoles} — answers the *first* conjunct only, and the store
 * clears a credential on `TournamentRemoved` alone, never on a drop, so
 * `roles.has("player")` stays true forever after a drop. A gate written on
 * possession alone therefore renders an affordance the broker refuses every
 * time; both player affordances need this conjunct too.
 *
 * Positive polarity on purpose: callers write
 * `roles.has("player") && isActiveEntrant(...)`, a plain conjunction, so no
 * edit can silently lose a `!`.
 *
 * Fails closed in both directions. An absent `playerKey` (a spectator) is not
 * active. A `playerKey` absent from `view.players` is not active either —
 * and that is sound rather than merely cautious, because `players` is a full
 * history that keeps dropped entrants listed (`adapter/types.ts`'s
 * `TournamentView` doc: *"dropped players stay listed (their `dropped` flag
 * is the distinction to render)"*), so absence means "not an entrant of the
 * tournament this view describes" — a foreign or not-yet-seeded view — never
 * "an entrant whose row was filtered out". If the broker ever did start
 * filtering dropped entrants out of `players`, this still answers `false`,
 * which is still the correct gate.
 *
 * "Active entrant" is the wire's own vocabulary for exactly this predicate,
 * not a coinage: `TournamentSummary.player_count` is documented as
 * "**Active** entrants — `TournamentMeta::active_player_count`", i.e. the
 * count of entrants for which this function is true.
