 * The official lobby broker for THIS build's release channel.

 * Channel-scoped rather than a single fixed address. The lobby advertises its
 * versions blind (it sends `ServerHello` before the client's `ClientHello`), and
 * clients built before `lobby_protocol_version` existed accept a lobby only
 * within `[PROTOCOL_VERSION - 1, PROTOCOL_VERSION]` of their OWN build.
 * Production's Worker redeploys only at release while preview rebuilds from
 * `main`, so once `main` is two protocol bumps past the last tag those windows
 * are disjoint and a single shared lobby must lock one channel out.
 *
 * `LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (see `ws-adapter.ts`) removes that coupling for
 * current builds, but already-deployed clients still gate on the shared number —
 * so each channel keeps its own broker. `deploy.yml` sets this to the preview
 * lobby.
 *
 * Defaults to the production lobby, so release and self-hosted builds are
 * unchanged.

 * `web.defaultMultiplayerServerUrl`. With no override the define is used
 * unchanged, which is what every official build does. A malformed value is
 * ignored rather than propagated: a typo'd address would otherwise become the
 * seed for every new profile, with nothing to tell the player why nothing
 * connects.

 * Read once at module load: `serverDetection` derives `SERVER_PRESETS` from
 * this at import time, so re-reading later would let the picker and the store
