 * tied-max group that rerolled) plus the authoritative winner (CR 103.1). The
 * overlay renders it round-by-round so the winner is always the high roller of
 * the round shown — fixing the prior last-roll-per-player collapse, which could
 * surface an eliminated seat's higher earlier die as beating the winner's lower
 * reroll. `startingPlayer` is the engine's pick (never recomputed here); it
 * equals the event's `winner` by construction. No-ops when no contest ran
 * (explicit play/draw choice).
