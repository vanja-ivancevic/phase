# a Darwin host no matter what the tree contains: `probe-pin check` reaches `isolate::run`
# unconditionally from `pipeline()` (crates/probe-pin/src/main.rs:145 — the baseline run, before
# any mutant), and that spawns `unshare` (crates/probe-pin/src/isolate.rs:157). Scoped as a rule

# is precisely how a resource below came to sit here ungated. Gate their auto_init rather than
# let them boot straight into a permanent red: a gate that is red on every change teaches
# everyone to stop reading the colour, which costs more than the gate earns. They stay VISIBLE

# THE OPERATIVE GUARD IS THE PROBE COUNT below:
# it is a property of this manifest, re-checkable from this file, and it is what actually decides
# whether these figures still describe the set. THE ROWS BELOW ARE A CLOSED RECORD OF ONE MEASUREMENT --

#   tool build, cold (fresh target/probe-pin)    6.91s   tool build, incremental   0.10s
#   the full probe set, engine target unchanged 14.7s    (two runs: 14.69 / 14.80)
#   the full probe set, AFTER an ENGINE_SRC edit 47.1s   SEQUENTIALLY AFTER build-native, and
#                                                        with the shared target/ already warm
#   THIS RESOURCE'S OWN cmd, as shipped:  cold 22.99s   incremental 15.61s   (isolated tree)
#
# EVERY row above, the last included, was timed BEFORE this resource existed -- the earlier wording
# ("every row except the last") implied the last one was taken through the resource, and it was not.
# The rows above it ran through the `cargo probe-pin` alias; the last is the resource's own cmd, run
# by hand, which is the price 'probe-pin-check''s note actually
# asks for; it is taken in an isolated tree whose dedicated CARGO_TARGET_DIR stands in for the
# shared target/, so it does NOT cover the two hazards below -- those need a real `tilt up`.
#
# => resource cold: read the as-shipped row above (22.99s), which measures it directly; the
#    earlier SUM-of-alias-rows derivation is deleted, superseded by that row per this file's rule.
#    ~14.8s when only this manifest or the census file changed;
#    ~47.2s on an engine-source edit, which is the common trigger -- under the two premises
#    named on the 47.1s row above, both of which this resource's own wiring can violate. See
#    "TWO PRICE HAZARDS" below; they are DISCLOSED, not measured.
#
# THE ENGINE BUILD *IS* ADDITIONAL -- 'probe-pin-check''s note was right to flag it, and measuring
# it was not a formality. `build-native` runs `cargo nextest run -p phase-engine -p phase-ai --no-run`;
# probe-pin's inner resolve runs `cargo test -p phase-engine --test integration --no-run`. The
# two keep SEPARATE artifact sets (different feature unification across the -p set), so after an
# ENGINE_SRC touch the inner resolve costs 32.86s even with build-native already complete --
# against 31.20s with no build-native at all. It saves 1.7s of 32.9s. Both sets then sit at a
# fixed point until the next source change: 0.42s / 0.12s respectively, so they do NOT ping-pong.
#
# TWO PRICE HAZARDS THE FIGURES ABOVE DO NOT COVER -- INCLUDING the as-shipped row. Stated, NOT
# measured: both are properties of a real `tilt up` and neither can be timed from a shell, so
# pricing this resource's cmd in an isolated tree does not settle them. BOTH NUMBERS ARE STILL
# OWED (see 'probe-pin-check''s note above).
#  1. `tilt up -- lint` PAYS A PARTIAL COLD ENGINE BUILD. Every figure above was taken against a
#     warm target tree -- the alias rows against the shared target/, the as-shipped row against
#     its isolated stand-in. Of the labels=['lint'] resources this is the only one whose cargo work
#     lands in the shared target/ -- clippy uses target/clippy, probe-pin-check target/probe-pin,
#     probe-pin-e2e target/probe-pin-e2e, check-frontend runs no cargo at all. BUT THE LABEL IS
#     NOT THE OPERATIVE SET: everything with auto_init = True also runs under `tilt up -- lint`,
#     and 'draft-pools' (auto_init = True) runs `cargo run --bin draft-pool-gen` with NO
#     CARGO_TARGET_DIR, dev profile, on draft-core -- which depends on phase-engine. So the
#     shared tree is PARTIALLY warmed at init: phase-engine's lib and its dependency graph get
#     built there. What is NOT warmed is the part this resource pays for -- the integration test
#     binary, the engine's dev-dependencies, and anything only `build-native` builds
#     (auto_init = 'test' in enabled, so it does not run under a lint-only profile).
#     THE SIZE OF THE RESIDUAL IS UNMEASURED, and no figure in this comment bounds it: a cold
#     `nextest --no-run` over these packages is both a different command and a FULLY cold tree,
#     which is not the state a lint-only `tilt up` leaves. Re-pricing this under a real
#     lint-only `tilt up` settles the number; it is owed, not measured.
#  2. THE 47.2s ASSUMES SEQUENTIAL ORDERING, which nothing now imposes. It was timed as
#     build-native then probe-pin -- the order `resource_deps` would have forced, and there is
#     deliberately no `resource_deps` (below). Both are allow_parallel and both fire on a
#     crates/engine/src/ edit, so the inner `cargo test --no-run` can queue on the SHARED build
#     lock behind build-native's ~82s nextest. The clippy comment above states the same
#     mechanism from the other side: a separate CARGO_TARGET_DIR "gives it its own build lock,
#     so it never queues behind the native test builds". The TOOL build here does have such a dir;
#     the INNER engine resolve does not, by the choice in the next paragraph -- and it is the inner
#     one that queues. 47.2s is therefore a floor, not a ceiling. Under a lint-only
#     profile the contender is not build-native (which never starts) but 'card-data': auto_init
#     = True, deps = ENGINE_SRC, and gen-card-data.sh runs `cargo build --profile tool` into
#     ${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}/tool -- a different profile dir in the SAME target root, and
#     the cargo build lock is per target ROOT (the 'wasm' comment above states this).
#
# The tool is built into target/probe-pin-census (its own dir, see the cmd comment) and then
# invoked as a BINARY. The split is deliberate and it is the SHELL that draws it: a prefix
# assignment binds only the command it prefixes, so CARGO_TARGET_DIR covers `cargo build` and is
# already unset by the time the binary runs. probe-pin's own inner `cargo test --no-run` therefore
# INHERITS an unset CARGO_TARGET_DIR and resolves the integration binary out of the SHARED target/
# -- the same tree every other cargo resource builds into, rather than a second private one.
# Putting CARGO_TARGET_DIR on the `cargo probe-pin` alias instead would push a second, cold engine
# build into target/probe-pin-census. What warms the shared tree is whatever else
# happened to run; this resource orders itself behind nothing, which is hazard 2.
# NO `resource_deps`. MEASURED, not preferred: 'build-native' auto-inits only under the `test`
# profile and this resource only under `lint` (plus the platform gate, which only narrows it
# further), so under `tilt up -- lint` it would wait forever on a resource that never starts --
# merged, green in the file, and enforced NOWHERE, in the only venue this manifest has.
# The PROFILES are named rather than the two `auto_init` expressions quoted: the argument rests
# only on neither condition implying the other, and a quoted expression is a second copy to keep
# in sync -- which is exactly how this sentence came to misquote the resource below.
#
# Every other resource_deps pair in this Tiltfile satisfies "dependent auto-inits =>
# dependency auto-inits" (test-engine/test-ai -> build-native, same group; test-frontend ->
# wasm and coverage -> card-data, dependency always inits; caddy -> frontend violates it only
# under `tilt up -- https tauri`, which nothing rejects, so that pair is already a violation
# and this one would be the second -- the first that fires under a profile the file itself
# documents). Price of not depending on it: build-native saves 1.7s
# of 32.9s on the inner resolve WHEN THE TWO RUN IN SEQUENCE (see the numbers above) -- not worth
# a venue that silently does not run. The parallel case is hazard 2, and it is the price of this
# choice, stated rather than netted out.
#
# PLATFORM: Linux-only, under the file-wide probe-pin policy and for the reason that policy
# states -- this cmd is `probe-pin check`, and that reaches `unshare` unconditionally (see the
# IS_LINUX note at the top of this file for the two coordinates). What the gate BUYS is only
# that a Darwin host does not boot this resource into a red it can never clear; what it does NOT
# buy is any enforcement of the pin off Linux. There is no CI venue to fall back to -- MEASURED:
# `grep -rn probe-pin .github/workflows/` returns nothing, which is the state 'probe-pin-check''s
# note calls a hard stop -- so off Linux this pin's verdict is carried entirely by whatever Linux
# venue last ran it. That is the identical shape 'probe-pin-e2e' states for Tier 2, and it is
# stated here rather than inferred from the flag.
