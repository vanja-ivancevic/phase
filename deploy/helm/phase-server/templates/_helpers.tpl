{{- /* The host and optional port of an address the client parses, shared by
     every validator that checks one. Each validator anchors it between its own
     scheme and path rules, so what counts as a well-formed host is decided once.

     The host is matched as one of three things rather than as "a run of
     characters that are not delimiters": a bracketed IPv6 literal (RFC 4291,
     IPv4-mapped forms included), a dotted-quad IPv4 literal, or a DNS name
     whose final label starts with a letter. That last condition is what keeps
     the two branches apart. URL parsing decides a host is IPv4 by looking at
     its final label, so `999.999.999.999` and `1.2.3.4.5` are IPv4 attempts
     that fail rather than hostnames that succeed, and `0x7f` is a number, not
     a name. A final label starting with a letter cannot be read as either.

     The chart is deliberately stricter here than the parser, which also
     accepts numeric shorthands: a bare integer (`2130706433`), a partial quad
     (`127.1`), and hex or octal octets all resolve to real addresses. None is
     a thing an operator means to type into a server address, and every one of
     them reads as a typo, so the chart refuses them. The rule is only ever
     safe in this direction: the chart must never accept what the parser
     rejects, and may refuse what the parser would have taken.

     No whitespace is allowed here, and each validator anchors its shape at both
     ends and admits only printable ASCII (`!` through `~`) after the authority,
     so a space, a control character or anything outside ASCII must arrive
     percent-encoded. That is deliberately stricter than the client. WHATWG URL
     parsing does not merely reject whitespace — it throws on an embedded space,
     but SILENTLY STRIPS a tab or newline, so "wss://host<TAB>name" parses to the
     host "hostname". A literally-equivalent rule would therefore accept a value
     that sends players to a host the operator never typed, which is the same
     class of failure these guards exist to prevent, just quieter. Reject the lot
     and say so.

     The path rule is spelled as a range, not as "not whitespace" (`\S`): helm
     matches with Go's RE2, chartUrlGrammar.test.ts compiles the same pattern as
     a JavaScript RegExp, and the two disagree on what whitespace is. That test
     refuses any construct not compared under both engines. */}}

{{- /* Require an immutable image reference unless mutability is affirmed.

     The SPA is a sidecar in the pod that serves /ws, so a tag that moves under
     the deployment does not merely restyle the site — a bad or missing pull
     takes the game server down with it. Defaulting to a mutable tag would make
     `web.enabled: true` quietly widen the blast radius of every registry-side
     change, so the default is a digest and mutability has to be asked for by
     name.

     The two settings are mutually exclusive rather than merely redundant. A
     digest wins over a tag in an image reference, so `followServerTag: true`
     alongside a digest renders `repo:v<new>@sha256:<old>` — a reference whose
     tag reads current and whose bytes are whatever was pinned. That is worse
     than either choice made alone, because it looks like the tracking that was
     asked for while behaving as the pin that was not. An explicit
     `web.image.tag` is refused with tracking for the same reason: it is the
     tag that would be followed, so setting both means the SPA follows a tag
     the server does not use.

     Tracking also requires `image.tag` to be set, because otherwise there is
     nothing being tracked: the SPA tag falls back to `v<Chart.AppVersion>`, a
     constant this chart carries rather than the release a deployment runs, and
     the appVersion is not bumped at release. For the server image that
     fallback names a tag that exists; for the SPA it names one that never
     will, since the SPA is published only from the release its job first runs
     on. Enforcing it here turns that into a render failure rather than an
     ImagePullBackOff on the pod that also serves /ws.

     Retire this rule if the tag fallback ever becomes release-tracking — put
     `appVersion` in the release replacements, or give the chart a tracking
     authority that is not a constant. The rule exists because the fallback is
     a constant, not because tracking needs a tag spelled out twice. */}}
