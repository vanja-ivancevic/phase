# Stamps the CR 603.7 `TriggerFiring` carriers that upstream #6842 (8121fd1c6)
# made mandatory onto an ALREADY-COMMITTED fixture, in place.
#
# WHY IN PLACE AND NOT A PRISTINE REGENERATION. `migrate-dump-fixture.sh`
# regenerates from the read-only pristine root, which is the stronger provenance and is
# preferred where it applies. IT APPLIES TO A `deck_size`-CARRYING FIXTURE NOW: that
# script's `--deck-size <Minimum|Exactly>:<count>` stage converts the pre-U5 bare `N`
# from an operator-supplied variant, so a regeneration from the UNMIGRATED pristine root
# — and with it that script's `--control` comparison — is runnable for any fixture
# carrying a `deck_size`. The pristine root itself never has to be touched.
#
# THE REASON THAT STANDS IS THE PARSER-STATE ONE, and it was always the load-bearing
# half. A committed fixture can differ from its pristine regeneration inside an object's
# `abilities` / `base_abilities` AST, because the fixture carries a LATER parser state
# than the 2026-07-22/25 capture. WHICH objects and WHICH cards is a property of the
# parser on the day, not of these files, so naming them here rots — read the divergence
# off the artifacts with
#   diff <(gzip -dc <fixture> | jq -S .gameState) <(unzip -p <dump> | jq -S .gameState)
# Rerunning from pristine would silently REVERT that state. Stamping in place is additive
# and cannot revert anything. The deck-size stage does not touch that ground.
#
# RESIDUAL: the exact per-fixture object difference is unmeasured here, and this file
# does not quote one — a transcribed corpus figure rots, and the committed population is
# regenerated with `find crates/engine/tests/fixtures -name '*.json.gz'`. What moved is
# only the residual's PRECONDITION, from a migrated pristine root (out-of-repo work) to a
# `--deck-size` regeneration, which is now runnable: the measurement is closeable rather
# than blocked.
#
# Its arm-1 control is strictly stronger than a difference check: the stamped artifact
# minus the stamped keys — the exact `del()` list below — must be BYTE-IDENTICAL to what
# was committed, which proves zero collateral change.
#
# The derivation is NOT re-spelled here — it is loaded from
# scripts/lib/trigger-firing.jq, the same single definition
# `migrate-dump-fixture.sh` uses. See that file for the CR 603.1 vs CR 603.7a
# discriminant and for why `UnknownLegacy` is not a legal persisted value.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/stamp-fixture-firing.sh crates/engine/tests/fixtures/name.json.gz [...]
#   scripts/stamp-fixture-firing.sh --control crates/engine/tests/fixtures/name.json.gz
#
# It stamps TWO field classes, both made mandatory-or-repaired by #6842:
#   1. the CR 603.7 firing carriers themselves; and
#   2. the CR 603.7 delayed-trigger ALLOCATORS
#      (`next_delayed_trigger_token` / `..._instance`), which #6842 repairs at
#      load time on the PRODUCTION decode path only. Left unstamped, a legacy
#      dump restores 0 through a bare `GameState` decode and 1 through the
#      production decoder, so the two paths disagree — and 0 is the value the
#      engine's own coherence validator rejects. Stamping the repaired value on
#      disk keeps the decoders in agreement WITHOUT weakening any assertion.
#
# A PARTIAL CHECK CERTIFIES NOTHING. Each arm states its own subject and reports its own
# verdict, and a conclusion may only be drawn from the arms that actually RAN — an arm
# reporting `n/a` has certified nothing. The arms are labelled where they run rather than
# inventoried here, because a private copy drifts from the code:
#   grep -inE '^ *# arm [0-9]' scripts/migrate-dump-fixture.sh scripts/stamp-fixture-firing.sh
# The pre-flight controls that carry no arm label are reached by:
#   grep -n '_control || exit 1' scripts/stamp-fixture-firing.sh

#
# The header above claims in-place stamping "cannot revert anything". Arm 1 cannot
# check that claim for the five stamped keys, because it DELETES exactly those keys
# from both sides before comparing — the one blind spot in an otherwise strong control.
# So a carrier that was already canonical (a modern capture, or an engine-side
# migration) could have been silently rewritten to "Ordinary", which is the CR 603.7a
# to CR 603.1 re-classification `lib/trigger-firing.jq` exists to refuse.
#
# The NEGATIVE half is what makes it non-vacuous: an ABSENT carrier must still be
# derived, or "preserved everything" would also describe a stamp that did nothing.
#
# VOCABULARY: these arms pin the LIVE `TriggerFiring` wire shapes
# (`types/identifiers.rs`): `"Ordinary"`, `"LegacyDelayed"`,
# `{"ReceiptEligible":{token,instance,source_id}}`, `"UnknownLegacy"`. They previously
# pinned `{"Delayed":null}`, a shape upstream #6933 removed. jq is untyped, so those arms
# stayed GREEN against a vocabulary the engine can no longer produce — a control passing
# on input the subject cannot emit is not evidence about the subject.
