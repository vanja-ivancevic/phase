#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Tests for scripts/lobby-servers.sh — the operator's handle on the lobby
# directory allowlist.
#
# What these exist for: the script is the ONLY way a server gets admitted to
# `GET /servers`, and every one of its failure modes is silent. A key written
# with a `ws://` scheme matches no row. A probe pointed at a path that is not
# `lobby_broker::directory::INFO_PATH` reports every server as unreachable. A
# `--env preview` that is not forwarded edits PRODUCTION. None of those
# produces an error anywhere — the listing is just quietly wrong.
#
# `npx`, `wrangler` and `curl` are stubbed on a narrowed PATH and record their
# argv, so the assertions are about what the script WOULD send, not about
# Cloudflare. `npx` is stubbed because the script invokes `npx wrangler` rather
# than a bare `wrangler` (the pinned binary lives in lobby-worker/node_modules
# and is not on an operator's PATH). Without the shim the narrowed PATH has no
# `npx` at all and every wrangler assertion below fails at exit 127 — measured,
# not hypothesised.
# jq's real directory is added to that PATH: the script parses `kv key list`
# output with it, and stubbing a JSON parser would test the stub.
#
# Venue: the Tilt `lobby-servers` resource (label 'lint'). NOT GitHub CI —
# enrolling a script gate there needs a `.github/workflows/**` edit, which is a
# hard stop for agent changes, the same reason `pnpm-preflight` and probe-pin
# live here. So this gate is local-only: a contributor who never runs
# `tilt up -- lint` never runs it.
