"""Tests for check-skill-doc.sh.

The script is a drift gate, so what matters is not that it runs but that it
refuses what it should. Every anchor row is a claim that renaming its symbol
breaks the build; a row that keeps passing after its symbol is gone is worse
than no row, because it reports green while the doc it guards has rotted.

That is not hypothetical. Two classes of it have already shipped:

  * An unanchored substring row absorbed its own longer siblings, so
    `fn parse_type_phrase` kept matching `parse_type_phrase_folding` and ~48
    `#[test] fn parse_type_phrase_*` names after the symbol it named was
    renamed away (phase-rs/phase#8613, #8633).
  * A row carrying no declaration keyword was satisfied by any mention, so
    `ROUTER_KEYWORD_CASES` matched a doc comment and a string literal and
    survived a rename of the `const` it documented (#8633 review).

Each case builds a throwaway repository from the real tree, mutates one thing
in it, and asserts the gate's behaviour there.
