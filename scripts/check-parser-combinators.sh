# Diff-based gate: new parser code must not introduce string-matching dispatch
# patterns. Forces nom combinators on first write per the CLAUDE.md mandate,
# rather than leaving refactor-to-combinators for review.
#
# Existing non-combinator code in the parser is frozen in amber — this check
# only flags *newly added* offending lines in the diff.
#
# Six forbidden pattern families:
#   (A) String-method dispatch: .strip_prefix / .contains("...") / .split_once
#       / .find("...") / .rfind("...") / .split("...") / .splitn / etc.
#       Use nom combinators (tag, alt, take_until) instead.
#   (B) Match-arm dispatch on string literals: `match expr { "foo" => ..., }`.
#       Discriminant is parser text; arms are literals. Use alt((tag(...))).
#   (C) Chained `if let Ok((rest, _)) = tag("…")(input)` blocks (≥2 in one
#       file). Sequential tag tries should compose into a single alt(()).
#   (D) Un-factored cross-product alt: a flat `alt` whose ≥4 `tag` arms share a
#       long common prefix AND suffix (e.g. "in addition to {its,their,...} other
#       [creature ]types"). Factor each varying axis into its own alt()/opt()
#       inside a sequence; see PATTERNS.md section 8b. Multi-line structural
#       check delegated to scripts/lib/detect-cross-product-alts.py.
#   (E) Verbatim-sentence equality: `lower == "twenty-five plus chars..."`.
#       Matching a whole Oracle sentence handles exactly one card — decompose
#       into typed building blocks (grammar prefix/suffix combinators).
#   (F) Hand-constructed `Effect::Unimplemented { .. }` literals. The single
#       authority is `Effect::unimplemented(name, fragment)` — it documents
#       the name-is-a-category-key contract the coverage report depends on.
#       Match-arm destructuring (`Effect::Unimplemented { name, .. } =>`) is
#       not flagged.
#
# Exempt: lines (or the line immediately above) with
#     // allow-noncombinator: <reason>
# Legitimate uses are rare (TextPair dual-string helpers, punctuation stripping
# on already-tokenized input, dynamic-string prefixes with runtime tag bodies,
# string assertions in tests).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-parser-combinators.sh [base-ref]
#
# Default base-ref is the merge-base with origin/main. In CI, pass the PR
# target branch's SHA explicitly.
#
# Exit status:
#   0  Gate A PASS      - the window was knowable and holds no violation. Either
#                         parser files were scanned and came back clean, or the
#                         window is well defined and holds no parser file at all
#                         (a commit that stages none, a base..head range that
#                         changes none). The second case also prints a SKIPPED
#                         line naming what was empty, so a reader can tell the
#                         two apart while `Gate A PASS head=<sha> base=<sha>`
#                         stays where contributor tooling reads it.
#   1  Gate A/G FAIL    - violations found.
#   3  CANNOT ANSWER    - the window itself is unknowable: base == head AND the
#                         index holds nothing in scope, so nothing at all was
#                         read. Not a failure - the same meaning exit 3 carries
#                         in scripts/tilt-wait.sh. See the guard below.

# (G) ROUTER/GRANT ARCHITECTURE GATE  — Plan 02 step 5 item 13 / step 7.
#
# WHOLE-FILE, not diff-based: this is an architecture invariant, so it is
# checked on every invocation regardless of what the diff touches.
#
# THE BOUNDARY. There are two keyword-parsing surfaces and they are NOT
# interchangeable:
#
#   parse_router_keyword_line()      STRICT, whole line. All-consuming: returns a
#   parse_router_keyword_list()      STRICT, keyword list (comma parts + MTGJSON).
#   parse_router_keyword_fragment()  STRICT, one keyword phrase.
#                                    These return a typed keyword ONLY when the text
#                                    parses completely (keyword + permitted P/R/M
#                                    tail). They are the ONLY surfaces that may
#                                    license a router to CONSUME a line.
#
#   parse_granted_keyword_fragment() PERMISSIVE. By design they take the leading
#   extract_granted_keyword_list()   keyword and DISCARD the remainder — correct
#                                    for an EMBEDDED grant ("...gains vanishing 3
#                                    if ..." inside a static/token/vote payload),
#                                    and invalid at a whole-line router boundary,
#                                    where the discarded remainder is dropped
#                                    SEMANTICS with no Unimplemented raised.
#
# A router that advances a line on a permissive parse is a SILENT SWALLOW: no
# keyword recorded, no diagnostic, and the card renders as fully supported.
#
# STATUS: MIGRATION COMPLETE (task #123). Plan 02 step 5 wired the strict router into
# priorities 9 and 13; task #123 migrated the remaining 16 permissive calls (priorities
# 0, 1b, 8f, the flashback/suspend/specialize/buyback/escalate/commander-ninjutsu/d20
# intercepts, and the two routing classifiers) onto the strict surfaces. The permissive
# symbols are now ABSENT from oracle.rs entirely — not merely unused, but not imported.
#
# This gate is therefore no longer a ratchet with an allowlist. It is the plain
# invariant Plan 02 step 7 asks for: NO permissive keyword-parser symbol may appear in
# a router context, at any count, ever. A reintroduction fails the build.
#
# SPAN EXTRACTION: from the `fn NAME(` signature at column 0 to the next `}` at
# column 0. Brace COUNTING would be wrong here — oracle.rs is saturated with mana
# symbols ("{T}", "{2}{B}") inside string literals, and a naive counter reads
# those as scope. rustfmt guarantees a top-level fn closes with `}` at column 0,
# so the anchor is exact. Full-line comments are excluded so that prose NAMING a
# permissive symbol is not miscounted as a call.

# DO NOT "harden" families (A), (B), (E), (F) by filtering them through the
# census lexer (scripts/zone_authority_census.py `strip_noncode`). It looks like
# the obvious single-authority move. It would BLIND this gate. (#76)
#
# Those families match ON the string literal itself:
#
#     .contains("        "lit" =>        == "long sentence"        name: "..."
#
# `strip_noncode` returns a code stream with literals REMOVED, so the very quote
# each pattern keys on is gone: every one of them would silently stop matching
# real violations, and the gate would pass string-matching parser code forever
# while reporting green. (Measured during #76: routing these through stripped
# code misread 194 REAL match arms as non-matches.)
#
# What they are exposed to is the mirror-image, and it is BENIGN: a forbidden
# pattern written inside a COMMENT or a literal is a FALSE HIT. That is loud (it
# blocks a commit, the author sees exactly why) and it already has an escape
# hatch (`// allow-noncombinator:`). #76 measured 10 such lines in the whole
# parser scope, all of them doc comments describing the forbidden pattern.
# A false MISS from this class is structurally impossible here: these greps read
# raw text, so literal-awareness could only ever REMOVE matches, never add them.
#
# If the false hits ever become a real cost, the fix is NOT strip_noncode: it is
# a POSITION mask (which character offsets are code vs comment vs literal), and
# these greps would filter candidates by match offset. Two APIs, one grammar.
#
# Family (D) is the opposite case and DOES delegate: it needs paren counting on
# CODE (see scripts/lib/detect-cross-product-alts.py), where a `)` inside
# `take_until(")")` is data. It reads structure from the code stream and arms
# from the raw text.

# `.trim_end_matches('.')` (char arg, structural cleanup), and the documented
# `.find(' ')` word-boundary-scan idiom are legitimate. strip_prefix /
# strip_suffix / split_once / rsplit_once / splitn almost always operate on

Two or more sequential tag tries in one file are the chained anti-pattern.
A single if-let-tag for an optional prefix is fine.

(E) Verbatim-sentence equality — the single most prohibited pattern:

A whole-sentence match handles exactly one card. Identify the grammatical
structure and parse each axis with combinators so the pattern covers every
card in the class.
