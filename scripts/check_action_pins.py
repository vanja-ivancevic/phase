"""Every external action reachable from a privileged workflow must be pinned.

Pinning only the workflow file being edited is not enough: a reusable workflow
or composite action it calls runs with the caller's secrets, so a mutable ref
one call away is the same exposure with less visibility. This walks those call
chains.

The walk parses YAML rather than matching `uses:` textually. A pattern misses
every form the parser accepts but the pattern does not -- `"uses":`, `'uses':`,
a flow mapping `{uses: ...}` -- and each of those is a way to put a mutable
action into a privileged workflow while the gate reports success.

PIN_CHECK_ROOT points the walk at a tree other than this checkout, so a trusted
copy of this script can audit an untrusted one's workflow files without running
anything from it.

Usage: check_action_pins.py [entry-workflow ...]
