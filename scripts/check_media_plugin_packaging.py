"""Every packaging consumer must ship the GStreamer packages the app declares.

`media_stack.rs`'s `REQUIRED_PLUGINS` is the single authority for the plugin
libraries WebKitGTK needs to play this app's audio, and each entry names the
Debian package that ships it. Two independent consumers have to act on that
list, and neither can see the other:

  * `tauri.conf.json`'s `bundle.linux.deb.depends`, which apt resolves when the
    `.deb` is installed; and
  * `shell-release.yml`'s Linux apt step, which is the entire set
    `linuxdeploy-plugin-gstreamer` has available to copy into the AppImage --
    it bundles what is installed on the runner and nothing else.

The AppImage consumer rests on a precondition its apt list means nothing
without: `bundle.linux.appimage.bundleMediaFramework` is what runs
`linuxdeploy-plugin-gstreamer` in the first place. Flipped off, no plugin is
copied however complete the runner's install is (issue #6744), and every
assertion about that apt step becomes vacuous. So the flag is read before the
step is, and a value other than `true` is refused rather than assumed.

They are checked separately rather than unioned. The `.deb` side already lists
all four packages, so a union would report a clean tree while the AppImage
shipped no AAC decoder -- which is exactly what #8615 was.

A degraded read is refused rather than tolerated. Every extractor here reduces
a file to a set of package names, and every way of failing to understand a file
produces the empty set, which subtracts to no gap and prints a pass. So an
unrecognised declaration raises `Refusal` instead of returning what it managed
to find: a gate that inspected nothing must not be indistinguishable from a
gate that found nothing wrong.

The apt extractor is coupled to a job name and a step name on purpose.
`shell-release.yml` has two Linux apt steps: `shell-preflight`'s runs
`cargo check` and bundles nothing, while `build-shell`'s produces the AppImage.
A file-wide scan would demand runtime GStreamer plugins on a compile-check job,
so the coupling is what keeps the requirement pointed at the step that can
actually satisfy it. When either name moves, this refuses rather than guesses.

MEDIA_PACKAGING_ROOT points every extractor at a tree other than this checkout,
which is how the tests drive it against throwaway fixtures.
