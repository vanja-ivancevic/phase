Usage: scripts/publish-status.sh --severity <s> --title <t> --body <b> [options]
       scripts/publish-status.sh --clear [--channel <c>] [--dry-run]

Publishes the operator status banner shown on / and /multiplayer.

Channels (--channel, default: local)
  local     client/public/status.json          served by `pnpm dev` at /status.json
  preview   phase-rs-data/staging/status.json  the PREVIEW site's data prefix
  release   phase-rs-data/status.json          production
  both      preview first, then release, with an identical payload and id

  NOTE: `--channel preview` writes the "staging/" prefix, NOT the unrelated
  "preview/" prefix that CI uses for per-PR preview data. "staging/" is what the
  preview site's DATA_BASE_URL resolves to.

Required for a publish
  --severity info|warning|critical
  --title <text>              One line. Whitespace-only is rejected.
  --body <text>               ONE PARAGRAPH — the banner renders it in a <p>
                              without whitespace-pre-line, so embedded newlines
                              do not display as breaks.

Options
  --until <ISO 8601>          Expiry instant; must parse under JS Date.parse.
                              Omitted => shows until cleared.
  --link <url>                http:// or https:// only. Requires --link-label.
  --link-label <text>         Requires --link.
  --dismissible               Force a dismiss button.
  --no-dismissible            Force no dismiss button.
                              Default: true, except --severity critical => false.
  --clear                     Remove the published message from the channel.
                              Cannot be combined with any payload flag.
  --dry-run                   Print what would happen; write nothing, call nothing.
  -h, --help                  This text.

Every publish mints a fresh epoch-ms `id`, and dismissal is compared by EQUALITY,
so re-running re-shows the banner to every player who had already dismissed it.
