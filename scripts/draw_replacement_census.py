"""Freeze the `ReplacementEvent::Draw` definition surface (Plan 03, CR 121 / CR 614).

Plan 03 rewrites draw delivery into a three-stage CR 121.2 state machine, which
requires every Draw replacement definition to declare, at construction, whether
it modifies the *instruction* count (CR 121.2a, "you draw that many cards plus
one instead") or replaces one *individual* draw (CR 121.2, "if you would draw a
card"). Scope is not derivable after the fact: today's `execute` chain, quantity
modification, description text, and count all fail to distinguish the two -- so
the rewrite has to set it at each producer, and a producer it misses gets a
silently wrong default.

This census freezes both halves of that surface so the rewrite cannot miss one:

  (A) --producers  the production sites that can mint a Draw definition
  (B) --corpus     the exported card corpus that carries one, with the scope
                   each row must be assigned

Section (A) is a source scan and runs anywhere. Section (B) needs the generated
`data/card-data.json`, which is gitignored and produced by a *different* CI job
than the Rust lint job -- so it is wired into the card-data gate, not the lint
gate. Running `--corpus` without card-data is an error, never a silent skip: a
gate that quietly passes when its input is missing is not a gate.

Both baselines are exact-match (not ratchets, unlike the zone-authority census):
an added, removed, or reclassified row fails until a human reviews it and
re-freezes with --write.

Usage:
    scripts/draw_replacement_census.py --producers --check   # gate (lint job)
    scripts/draw_replacement_census.py --corpus --check      # gate (card-data job)
    scripts/draw_replacement_census.py --producers --write   # re-freeze
    scripts/draw_replacement_census.py --corpus --write

#   => Ok(ReplacementEvent::Draw)                          -> family `event-decode`
#       database/forge/replacement.rs  (Result-returning, hence the Ok wrap)
#
# The `ReplacementDefinition { .. }` struct-literal family is a live idiom inside
# the engine:
# 50 literals across crates/engine/src (non-test files), 17 of them in
# database/synthesis.rs, 13 of those in production code. None is a Draw today, so
# the family has exactly one occupant -- but the next engine Draw written as a
# literal would have been invisible to a constructor+decode census.
#
# KNOWN-UNMATCHED, ZERO OCCUPANTS: a fourth mint shape exists in principle --
# field assignment after construction (`def.event = ReplacementEvent::Draw;`).
# None of the three patterns matches it. There are ZERO occurrences of
# `.event = ReplacementEvent::` anywhere under crates/ today (any variant, not
# just Draw), so the shape is latent rather than live. It is named here rather
# than silently omitted: an instrument that lists what it misses is honest; one
# that implies completeness is not.

# Matches ONE of the two live ways Rust code builds a `ReplacementDefinition`:
# the `::new(..)` builder. It does NOT match the other one -- a struct literal --
# which is why `STRUCT_LITERAL` below exists. Across `crates/` today: 429 `::new(`
# sites and 91 `ReplacementDefinition {` sites, so neither shape is exotic.
#
# Naming this "the way a definition is built in Rust" is a category error: a
# comment that describes a family instead of
# a pattern invites the reader to believe the pattern covers the family.
