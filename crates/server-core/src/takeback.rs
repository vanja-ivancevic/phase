//! "Request takeback" — multiplayer-safe undo (GH #1507).
//!
//! Single-player/local undo (`engine-wasm::restore_game_state`) replaces the
//! client's own state wholesale and is refused outright in multiplayer
//! sessions, because no client may unilaterally rewrite the authoritative
//! server state another player is relying on. This module gives multiplayer
//! sessions an equivalent escape hatch for misclicks and UI confusion,
//! without ever letting one player rewrite history unilaterally: a player
//! may request to roll the *authoritative* session state back to the
//! snapshot taken just before their most recent action, but the rollback
//! only takes effect once every human seat at the table (the requester
//! included) has approved it. Any single human decline cancels the request
//! and the authoritative state is left untouched.
//!
//! The same machine is parameterized by [`RewindTarget`] rather than
//! duplicated per granularity: `LastAction` is the original GH #1507 undo, and
//! `TurnStart` reaches a previous turn boundary — which the action-granular
//! ring structurally cannot, since every wire `PassPriority` burns one of its
//! twelve slots. Turn boundaries are captured from each transition's own
//! post-state into a second ring, and offered only where
//! [`offers_turn_rewind`] says so.
//!
//! This is intentionally a session/room-level concern, not an engine rule —
//! there is no Comprehensive Rules concept of "undo." The engine is never
//! told why it was handed an older `GameState`; it just continues from
//! whatever state it's given, exactly as it does on reconnect/restore.
