// engine-citation-gate: symbol anchors only
//! Controller-relative confinement of a polled player's priority window —
//! stage 2 of [`super::smart_shortcut_response`].
//!
//! CITATION FORM: rule NUMBER only, matching the enrolled test sibling
//! `tests/integration/shorten_efficacy.rs`. The number IS the greppable
//! heading — `grep '^400.1' docs/MagicCompRules.txt` resolves any citation
//! below. `docs/MagicCompRules.txt` is gitignored and re-fetched per checkout,
//! so a line anchor pins a citation to whichever rules revision its author
//! happened to hold.
//!
//! # 1. This is AI POLICY, not a rule
//!
//! CR 732.2b grants an **unconditioned** binary
//! option: "Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who
//! suggested the shortcut, may either accept the proposed sequence, or shorten
//! it by naming a place where they will make a game choice that's different
//! than what's been proposed." There is no criterion, no outcome test, and no
//! efficacy test; the rule explicitly does not even require the shortening
//! player to say what the new choice will be. CR 732.2c adds the only
//! obligation, and it is downstream: "the player who now has priority must make
//! a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player."
//! Activating a fetchland IS a different game choice, so a fetchland Shorten
//! fully satisfies it.
//!
//! Nothing in the Comprehensive Rules therefore grounds this module's decision.
//! It is an AI policy: a seat whose only available response cannot touch the
//! loop spends its window achieving nothing, and the engine should not burn a
//! real priority window on it. Every CR number below is cited **only for what
//! its text says**, and is used as an *input* the classifier reads (which zones
//! are per-player, who owns what) — never as a licence for the decision.
//!
//! # 2. Fail-closed direction, and why the wildcard is conservative HERE
//!
//! [`WindowReach::MayInterfere`] is the default for every unrecognized shape.
//! That direction is deliberate and is the opposite of the discipline
//! `game::ability_scan` enforces on itself. `ability_scan`'s default is
//! `Axes::NONE` ("this ability reads nothing"), which is its *unsafe*
//! direction — a newly added reader classified inert would ride a false
//! auto-resolution — so that module forbids wildcards outright. Here the
//! default says "this action might interfere", which can produce only a **false
//! `Shorten`** (the polled seat takes a priority window it did not need — it
//! costs beats, never a game) and **never a false `Accept` from a shape it does
//! not recognize** (a seat accepting its own loss while holding a real out).
//! The qualifier is load-bearing; see the residual below. An unknown nesting
//! container is interference regardless of what it nests, so there is no
//! nested-carrier set and no recursion-arm set left to drift, and no
//! hand-maintained allowlist to rot.
//!
//! That argument covers unrecognized *shapes*, and it leaves exactly one
//! residual uncovered: a clause the PARSER silently swallows never becomes a
//! shape here at all, so the ability this module is handed looks strictly MORE
//! confined than the printed card is — and narrowing apparent reach is the
//! dangerous direction, because it produces a false `Accept`, not a false
//! `Shorten`. The residual is stated structurally rather than pinned to a card,
//! because a card witness is only valid until the classifier moves under it:
//! this doc previously named `Invoke Justice[0]` — a lone
//! [`Effect::ChangeZone`] (`origin: Graveyard`, `target: Typed{controller:
//! You}`, no cost, no `sub_ability`) whose printed sentence continues "then
//! distribute four +1/+1 counters among any number of creatures and/or Vehicles
//! target player controls" — and the entry gate added below has since
//! reclassified it `MayInterfere`, because its battlefield entry is not
//! provably tapped. That narrowed the residual; it did not close it. What
//! remains live is the same shape at a destination the entry gate does not
//! constrain: a non-battlefield destination, or a provably tapped entry. No
//! widening of this module can reach any of it — it cannot read a clause that
//! never arrived, so the residual is owned by the parser, not the classifier.
//!
//! The structural guard is the compiler, not a test:
//! [`ability_window_reach`] destructures [`AbilityDefinition`] **without
//! `..`**, and every allowlisted [`Effect`] arm is likewise `..`-free, so a new
//! field on the definition or on an allowlisted variant fails to compile until
//! it is classified. Precedent: `game::ability_scan::ability_definition_axes`.
//!
//! # 3. `analysis::ability_graph::collect_effects` is deliberately NOT used
//!
//! Two independent reasons, one mechanism. Its inner recursion ends `_ => {}`
//! (`analysis/ability_graph.rs`, whose own doc says "a wildcard covers the leaf
//! variants") — silent fail-open. And it walks **4 of `AbilityDefinition`'s 38
//! fields** (`effect`, `sub_ability`, `else_ability`, `mode_abilities`); it
//! never inspects `cost` at all, so `Sacrifice` / `Discard` / `Mill` /
//! `ExileMaterials` costs — every one of which can reach another player's
//! resources — would be structurally invisible.

        //   graveyard-recursion shape reaching the battlefield untapped is the
        //   same defect through the other door.
        // * `Hand` — a card put into hand is a CASTABLE card. When the spell that
        //   put it there finishes resolving, the active player receives priority
        //   (CR 117.3b) and priority then passes in turn order (CR 117.3d), so the
        //   responding seat gets it back still inside this window and can cast it.
        //   That is the `Effect::Mana` argument with one extra step, exactly as the
        //   untapped fetch was, and the AST carries nothing that could prove the
        //   returned card uncastable. MEASURED with the hand gate held off, 327
        //   abilities are confined and 176 of them move a card to hand — 166
        //   through this arm and 10 through the `SearchLibrary` split, which is
        //   why both doors now share `landing_zone_is_confined`. The witnesses are
        //   instant-speed: `Auroral Procession` returns ANY graveyard card,
        //   including an instant. Gating both doors leaves 151 confined abilities,
        //   102 of which reach the battlefield, so the flagship tapped-fetch
        //   Accept is untouched: this closes a door, it does not vacate the
        //   feature.
        //
        // No other destination is gated, and that is a claim about what the seat
        // can act with, not an oversight: a move to graveyard, library or exile

        // inside this window without some FURTHER permission, which would itself
        // be an ability this fold already reads.

        // (`object_window_reach`, `indexed_ability_window_reach`) — so a
        // `target: SelfRef` recursion, where the card that arrives IS the source,
        // is already covered by it. For every other target shape the arriving
        // card is a DIFFERENT object, and the gate has never been run on it.
        //
        // `Library` narrows that hole but does NOT close it, and the earlier
        // version of this comment claimed it did. It argued that CR 400.2 makes a
        // library a hidden zone and the card an unchosen member of it, so "the
        // seam is handed a `GameState` and a list of `GameAction`s, and the card
        // is the subject of neither, so there is nothing to read". The premise is
        // wrong as a fact about this engine. MEASURED on the enrolled 4p dump at
        // the exact poll this module decides at: the actor's library is 91 cards
        // and ALL 91 resolve in `state.objects` carrying full parsed rules
        // content — 5 of them with triggers, and one of those is **Bojuka Bog**
        // ("This land enters tapped. / When this land enters, exile target
        // player's graveyard. / {T}: Add {B}.", Oracle text verified on
        // Scryfall), whose ETB exiles a graveyard the actor does not own.
        // CR 701.23a is the rule that makes it reachable: "To search for a card
        // in a zone, look at all cards in that zone (EVEN IF IT'S A HIDDEN ZONE)
        // and find a card that matches the given description." Hidden means the
        // opponents cannot see it; it never meant the searcher cannot choose it.
        //
        // `board_observer_may_react` genuinely cannot catch this, and for a
        // CORRECT reason rather than an omission: CR 113.6, via
        // `trigger_definition_functions_in_zone`, answers "does not function" for
        // a card sitting in a library. That predicate scans triggers that
        // function NOW; the hazard is a trigger that will function once the
        // search puts the card onto the battlefield.
        //
        // So the arriving card is classified where it can be: at the object
        // level, by `library_arrivals_are_inert`, which runs
        // `carries_unreadable_rules_content` over exactly the cards the actor
        // could select. That gate is a board fact, not an AST fact, which is why
        // it lives at the two entry points instead of in this arm.
        //
        // A `Graveyard`, `Hand` or `Exile` origin is a DIFFERENT situation and
        // was previously admitted on the same warrant. There the arriving card
        // IS in `state.objects`, its rules content is readable, and the fold
        // simply never looked — so `OwnResourcesOnly` was asserted over text
        // nobody had classified. Helping Hand ("Return target creature card with
        // mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped.",
        // Oracle text verified on Scryfall) read `OwnResourcesOnly` while a

/// inputs rather than as a blanket: a permanent that arrives TAPPED and still
/// enables interference through an ability whose cost is not tapping (a
/// sacrifice-for-mana, say).
///
/// That residual is scoped to ONE origin, and the scoping is enforced in code
/// rather than promised here. `effect_window_reach`'s `ChangeZone` arm admits a
/// battlefield entry only when `origin == Some(Zone::Library)`, and what the
/// arriving card can DO is then classified by [`library_arrivals_are_inert`],
/// which both entry points run.
///
/// The residual is what THAT gate leaves, and it is narrower than the whole
/// fetch class: `carries_unreadable_rules_content` is a presence check, so a
/// selectable card with no trigger, replacement, static or keyword passes it
/// while still carrying an ACTIVATED ability whose cost is not tapping. Such a
/// card arrives tapped (the arm requires it) and can still be sacrificed for
/// value inside this window.
///
/// This paragraph previously claimed the residual was total and unreachable, on
/// the argument that CR 400.2 makes the library hidden so "neither input
/// contains it and neither the per-action fold nor the board scan has an object
/// to read". That was measurably false — the enrolled 4p dump resolves all 91 of
/// the actor's library cards in `state.objects` — and CR 701.23a is the rule it
/// mistook: a search looks at all cards in the zone "even if it's a hidden
/// zone". `board_observer_may_react` really does miss them, but for the CR 113.6
/// reason (`trigger_definition_functions_in_zone` answers "does not function" for
/// a library card), which is why the selection gate is separate from it.
///
/// A `Graveyard`, `Hand` or `Exile` origin is a different situation again — the
/// arriving card is named by the effect's own target rather than chosen out of a
/// pool — and it is not in this residual because the arm no longer admits it. See
/// that arm's fourth battlefield conjunct for the measurement and the efficacy
/// trade.
///
/// Its cost, on both axes, for the reader deciding whether that matters:
///   - across windows: a bounded miss — a seat's fetched answer goes unused for
///     THIS shortcut;
///   - within the window: NOT bounded by "one shortcut". On an `UntilLethal`
///     offer the accepted sequence runs to lethal, so the in-window cost of a
///     missed out is elimination.
///
/// The miss requires the out to be reachable ONLY through the fetched permanent
/// AND that permanent to arrive tapped; a directly-castable answer is already
/// caught by the top-level fold, and CR 732.1b makes shortcut use permissive
/// ("can be used") rather than guaranteed.
///
