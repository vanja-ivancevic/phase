//! Candidate validation pipeline.
//!
//! A [`CandidateFilter`] rejects [`CandidateAction`]s that cannot legally be
//! performed in the current [`GameState`]. Filters are ordered cheapest-first:
//! trivial structural checks (zone legality, choice-index bounds) run before
//! the expensive catch-all that simulates the action via
//! `apply_as_current` and clones the full state.
//!
//! # Invariant — `cheap ⊆ simulate`
//!
//! Every cheap filter MUST be a subset of what [`SimulationFilter`] rejects:
//!
//! ```text
//! cheap.accept(state, candidate) == false
//!   ⇒
//! SimulationFilter.accept(state, candidate) == false
//! ```
//!
//! Without this property, a cheap filter could silently drop a candidate that
//! the simulation would accept — a correctness bug that surfaces as the AI
//! refusing to take legal actions. The property is enforced by the proptest
//! in the tests module.
//!
//! # Scope guardrail
//!
//! `CandidateFilter` validates candidate **actions** — it does not validate
//! target legality (that belongs in `game::targeting`) or replacement-effect
//! selection (that belongs in `game::replacement`). Adding game-rule verbs
//! ("resolve_trigger", "apply_damage") here is out of scope; this is a
//! structural legality pipeline, not a rules engine.
