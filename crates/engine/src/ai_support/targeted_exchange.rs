/// and does NOT target a freshly created object (token/emblem). Also falsified by a
/// new production site that constructs one of the two adverse shapes outside
/// Oracle lowering. **AND** falsified by (c) below. **AND** falsified by (b2).
///
/// (b2) THE BASIS MISMATCH — this is the load-bearing correction to the sentence
/// above, and it applies to BOTH branches, not just activations. The guard's basis
/// is the object's STORED ability lists; the binder composes STORED ⊕ SYNTHESIZED.
/// The falsifier paragraph audits INSTALLATION, so a definition that is built
/// rather than stored reaches the bind unseen by it AND by its re-audit grep,
/// which matches only assignment and `&mut` borrow of an ability field. Three
/// confirmed seams, each disposed differently and deliberately:
///
/// (i) SYNTHESIZED ON READ, DATA-DRIVEN (Activation) —
/// `casting::activated_ability_definitions` (casting.rs:458) hands the AI indices
/// `printed_len + offset` whose definitions are rebuilt per call from
/// `effective_off_zone_keywords` + `database::synthesis` and stored in no field.
/// RAILED at runtime by the `RootBinding::Activation` index gate below. A rail is
/// required here rather than a note, because the payload is card-data-driven
/// across `database/synthesis.rs` (~26k lines): it cannot be discharged by reading
/// one function, so the gate must hold regardless of what those families come to
/// synthesize.
///
/// (ii) SYNTHESIZED FROM A SCALAR, FIXED PAYLOAD (Cast) —
/// the Awaken branch of `casting::prepare_spell_cast_with_variant_override_inner`
/// appends `awaken::build_awaken_rider(count: u32)` to the bound spine. NOT railed,
/// for two independent reasons, and BOTH are needed: (1) unreachable today —
/// Awaken is elected by a separate `AlternativeCastDecision` GameAction
/// (`handle_awaken_cost_choice_with_payment_mode`, casting.rs:8933), not inline
/// during the root `CastSpell`, and `explore_target_children` follows only
/// `GameAction::ChooseTarget { target: Some(_) }`; (2) the payload is CLOSED — a
/// fixed `PutCounter` → `Animate` built by one 20-line function that can be read
/// in full. Note what is deliberately NOT the argument: cost. A Cast-branch rail
/// could discriminate on `Keyword::Awaken` rather than falling open on every
/// cast, so it would be near-free, and "a rail is expensive" would be FALSE here.
/// The reason is epistemic, not economic — reading `build_awaken_rider` in full
/// discharges the question, which is precisely what cannot be done for (i).
/// Discharged by a back-reference AT that function — the site where the payload
/// would change — which is the direction (c) below records this comment as
/// failing to provide.
///
/// READ (ii) AND (iii) TOGETHER: both go live under the SAME widening of
/// `explore_target_children` past target selection, for DIFFERENT reasons — (ii)
/// because its election is a separate GameAction, (iii) because its pending parks
/// in `WaitingFor::SpliceOffer`. Anyone widening that exploration must rail BOTH.
/// (ii) additionally needs a rail only if its payload stops being fixed; (iii)
/// needs one unconditionally, because its payload is arbitrary card text.
///
/// (iii) MERGED FROM ANOTHER OBJECT (Cast) — `splice::append_to_sub_chain`
/// (splice.rs:145) mutates the bound `PendingCast.ability` with
/// `combined_spell_ability_def` read off a DIFFERENT object (the splice card in
/// hand), whose payload is arbitrary card text and so COULD carry an adverse
/// shape. Unreachable today: `target_selection_owner` returns `None` for
/// `WaitingFor::SpliceOffer` and `explore_target_children` follows only
/// `GameAction::ChooseTarget`. This one becomes live — and needs a rail, not a
/// note — the moment that exploration widens past target selection.
///
/// The fourth append site in that same function is NOT a seam: its Fuse branch
/// merges `obj.back_face.abilities`, which the `back_face`
/// arm below already chains, so it composes STORED content and is covered. It is
/// listed here because an audit of the append sites will find it and needs the
/// verdict, not because it falsifies anything.
///
/// So the falsifier is: a new site that makes a definition REACHABLE TO THE BIND
/// without writing it to a `GameObject` field — synthesized, merged, or displaced
/// (`GameObject::cleave_form`, a `CleaveFormState`, holds the displaced printed
/// list; `GameObject::specialize_faces` installs faces through the same
/// `printed_cards::apply_back_face_to_object` the `back_face` arm exists to cover,
/// and `specialize::specialize_permanent` gates it on the battlefield so it
/// resolves after this window).
/// AUDIT INSTRUMENT — deliberately NOT "what do
/// `combined_spell_ability_def` / `activation_ability_definition` RETURN". That
/// question cannot find (ii): the `combined_spell_ability_def` call sits near the
/// TOP of `prepare_spell_cast_with_variant_override_inner` and the
/// `awaken::append_awaken_rider` call ~950 lines LATER in that same function,
/// after that return has already happened. A return-site instrument
/// is blind to every post-return append by construction — the same shape of
/// error as the sticker grep dissected above, which is why it is called out here
/// rather than left as a footnote.
/// Ask instead: WHAT DOES THE ABILITY LOOK LIKE AT THE POINT `PendingCast` IS
/// CONSTRUCTED? That is the def the judges actually walk, it is downstream of
/// every append, and it is position-independent. Concretely: read
/// `prepare_spell_cast_with_variant_override_inner` from its
/// `combined_spell_ability_def` call to its `PreparedSpellCast` construction and
/// account for every mutation of `ability_def` on the way. At the time of writing
/// that is eight sites — the initial read, one rebind, the Overload transform
/// (`overload::transform_effect_in_place` DROPS `damage_source` on its
/// `DealDamage` -> `DamageAll` arm, so it can only remove the shape),
/// the Awaken append (ii), and the four-line Fuse merge (stored, covered).
/// PAYLOAD-DISMISSAL RULE — (i) and (ii) sit on OPPOSITE sides of this, so it is
/// stated as a criterion rather than left for the reader to infer; without it the
/// two clauses read as contradictory and a maintainer will pick whichever suits.
/// Dismissing a seam on the grounds that its payload carries no adverse shape is
/// ADMISSIBLE only when that payload is CLOSED — bounded by reading one
/// non-data-driven function in full, as in (ii) (`build_awaken_rider`, 20 lines,
/// fixed shape). It is NOT admissible over a data-driven surface: "no synthesized
/// ability carries Fight today" across `database/synthesis.rs` (~26k lines) is a
/// grep-level negative, not a closure over helper composition — which is exactly
/// why (i) gets a runtime rail and (ii) does not. This guard's contract is that
/// `false` PROVES non-rejection, and a grep is not a proof.
///
/// Note what is deliberately NOT on that list: "an installer the cast path
/// provably never calls." That clause was carried for three rounds with an
/// instrument — a grep for LEAF installer names over three files — that could
/// not have detected its own falsity: `stickers.rs:490` is reached through a
/// WRAPPER (`zones.rs:511 rebuild_public_zone_stickers`) named in a file the
/// grep already covered, so the grep returned zero while the route existed.
/// (The route is in fact dead on a cast — `zones.rs:511` is inside
/// `if from == Zone::Battlefield {` at `zones.rs:482` — but an instrument that
/// is right by luck is not an instrument.) Dispose of a new site by reading ONE
/// function: what does it write, and where does the content come from. If a
/// negative reach claim is genuinely needed, discharge it with a BOUNDED
/// TRANSITIVE CALLER CLOSURE — enumerate every caller of the installer by exact
/// name, then every caller of each wrapper, until each terminating site's gate
/// has been read in source, quoting the ENCLOSING CONDITIONAL of every line.
///
/// (c) CR 123.5 DEPENDENCY — recorded, not hypothetical. This note is
/// ONE-DIRECTIONAL: it is discoverable from the guard's side only, and
/// nothing in `game/zones.rs`, where such a fix would be made, points back
/// to it. CR 123.5
/// says stickers "are retained as that object moves to a public zone and
/// continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone." The engine
/// implements only half of that: `zones.rs:468-471` clears on a move to a
/// hidden zone, and `zones.rs:508-513` re-applies ONLY on a battlefield exit
/// (`from == Zone::Battlefield`, `zones.rs:482`). A card carrying a sticker in
/// hand or library therefore keeps `obj.stickers` while `obj.abilities` never
/// reflects it, so this predicate and the bind (`casting::combined_spell_ability_def`)
/// read the same list and agree. IF THAT GAP IS EVER CLOSED — by un-gating
/// `zones.rs:508-513`, by widening `zones.rs:482`, or by adding an entry-side
/// install (`zone_pipeline.rs` today contains zero occurrences of "sticker") —
/// then an ability sticker's granted abilities are installed into `abilities`
/// during the cast's own move to the stack, i.e. AFTER this predicate has read
/// the object, from a payload (`obj.stickers`, Oracle TEXT) that no traversal
/// arm can reach without re-running the parser. This predicate is then UNSOUND
/// and needs a fall-open rail immediately below the `layers_dirty` one:
///     if crate::game::stickers::object_has_sticker_kind(
///         source, crate::types::stickers::StickerKind::Ability) { return true; }
/// `object_has_sticker_kind` (`game/stickers.rs:101`, unconditionally `pub`) is
/// `obj.stickers.iter().any(|s| s.kind() == kind)` — no allocation, no clone.
/// `StickerKind::Ability` is the correct discriminant: `stickers.rs:483` is the
/// sole gate on the path to the `abilities` write at `:490`.
///
/// Deliberately stated WITHOUT a reachability qualifier: deciding which of those
/// dispositions applies needs one function read, whereas deciding "is this
/// reachable from the cast reducer" needs a call-chain trace, and that trace was
/// got wrong in four consecutive reviews of this guard.
///
