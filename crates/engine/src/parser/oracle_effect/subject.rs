///     `TypedFilter`), but as a CONJUNCT they are indistinguishable from a
///     failed parse — unioning one re-widens the whole subject, reproducing
///     the pre-fix fail-open inside an `Or` wrapper. Model of Unity ("you and
///     each opponent WHO VOTED FOR A CHOICE YOU VOTED FOR may scry 2") is the
///     worked example: its restrictive relative clause is not modelled, so the
///     conjunct collapses to the default filter and `Or[Controller, <default>]`
///     would let every player scry.
///
///   * **Event-context anaphors** (`TriggeringSource`, `ParentTarget`, …).
///     These resolve through the TARGET/binding channel, not by object
///     matching — `game/filter.rs::filter_inner_for_object` maps every one of
///     them to `false` by design. Unioning one produces an `Or` whose branch is
///     inert, so the effect silently applies to only PART of the printed
///     subject. Wand of Orcus ("it and Zombies you control gain deathtouch")
///     is exactly this: the Zombies branch applies and the equipped creature's
///     does not. That is still a misparse, so it fails closed here. Carrying an
///     anaphor conjunct correctly needs the primary-subject + chained

/// subject: the ability's first object target, or the single cost-paid snapshot.
