//! Effect-chain assembly: `EffectChainIr` → `AbilityDefinition`.
//!
//! Plan 01 §6 (Unit 6): the single source-order assembly traversal lives here.
//! This module was created by relocating `lower_effect_chain_ir`'s body from
//! `lower.rs` VERBATIM (U6-A) — a byte-identical move with zero behavior change,
//! so the arena / `AssemblyEnv` / antecedent-resolution layer can be built inside
//! this file in later increments without also moving code at the same time.
//!
//! The clause-lowering helpers this traversal calls still live in `lower.rs`
//! (widened to `pub(super)` for this move); relocating them is a later increment.

// ===========================================================================
// AssemblyEnv (Plan 01 §6, U6-B1) — emit-time provenance + role registries
// ===========================================================================
//
// WRITE-ONLY THIS INCREMENT. Nothing reads these registries yet; the handlers
// still bind their antecedents positionally (`defs.last_mut()`, backward scans).
// U6-C flips the consumers over. Keeping population and consumption in separate
// commits means a bisect can never land on the bookkeeping.
//
// The shape here is dictated by the U6 `defs` audit:
//
//  * `origin` is `Option<ClauseId>`, NOT `ClauseId`. `apply_clause_continuation`
//    pushes nodes of its own (`sequence.rs` — e.g. the `SearchDestination`
//    `ChangeZone`), and those nodes belong to no clause. `FoldSearchIntoElse`
//    binds to exactly such a node, which is why a `ClauseId`-only arena key is
//    insufficient (audit §2). `origin: None` is that case, made concrete.
//
//  * Registries are recomputed against the CURRENT `defs` after every mutation
//    region, because `defs` is a `Vec` that handlers `pop()` and `mem::take()`.
//    Any index-keyed reference into it is invalidated by the next handler. That
//    fragility is not incidental — it is the argument for U6-C's stable arena
//    ids, and it is why these are recomputed rather than cached by index.
//
//  * These registries observe only TOP-LEVEL `defs` entries. Three of the real
//    consumers (`attach_alt_cost_to_prior_cast_from_zone`,
//    `attach_mana_retention_to_prior_mana`,
//    `find_prev_play_from_exile_permission_mut`) recurse INTO `sub_ability`
//    trees for the first node whose slot is still vacant (audit §6). They cannot
//    be served by a top-level registry at all — that is the node-granularity
//    decision U6-C must make first.

//    can migrate OUT of the node-set (nested by a handler, or wrapped into an

    // divergence. Reopen only if a card establishes that a continuation must cross
    // such a veto; carry an explicit antecedent handle rather than weakening this guard.
    // Closed by plan-r17 §R17.4.1 — the leading-if body split's absorbed clauses are now
    // classified against the OUTER registry, because placement is resolved by a fold over the
    // finished clause sequence rather than at a push site. Residual: the fold cannot see a
    // non-`Emit` disposition's relationship to its absorb TARGET — an `Absorb` rider that
    // merges INTO the installer clause still CLEARS the registry rather than passing through,
    // so a continuation after such a rider stays a sibling. That is today's behaviour, chosen
    // because the alternative (pass-through) can only ADD mis-attachments. Reopen with a card
    // whose installer carries an absorbed rider AND a following continuation; the fix is to
    // resolve the absorb target before the fold, not to widen the disposition gate.
    // Deferred — coin/die consolidation is top-level only. Goblin Kites, Fickle
    // Efreet, and Frenetic Sliver keep their flip and branch on opposite sides of
    // the payload boundary. Reopen when they share a payload, a fourth row appears,
    // or a double-flip report arrives; a payload-descending pass needs review.
    // Deferred — payload-`sub_ability`-invisible anaphor rewrite: the effect-space
    // recursion below delayed-trigger payloads cannot rewrite a continuation's
    // LastCreated binding. Reopen on T-ROW5, a wider Elemental Appeal consumer
    // probe, or a bare-pronoun misbinding; any definition-space repair is pool-wide.
    // Deferred — resolve_populated_token_anaphors cannot reach payload.sub_ability:
    // its effect-space recursion receives inner.effect, never inner. Reopen when
    // T-ROW5 reds, the consumer probe exceeds Elemental Appeal, or a bare pronoun
    // misbinds; a definition-space recursion would be a pool-wide widening.
    // Deferred — relocated Jodah cleanup normalization: relocation can put the
    // `ExileFromTopUntil` → optional `CastFromZone { ParentTarget }` → bottom
    // `PutAtLibraryPosition { TrackedSet }` triple inside a delayed payload, but
    // `normalize_linked_exile_cast_pair` examines adjacent top-level definitions
    // only. Its lower-layer gate documents that the parser-default `TrackedSet`
    // has no publisher for this exile pile, leaving the pile stranded. This
    // worktree's delayed-trigger integration test asserts Codie's three node
