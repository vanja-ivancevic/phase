/// — never the inverse blanket restriction — on the SINGLE-RETURN
/// `parse_static_line` path. Whether the LINE then ends up honestly unsupported
/// is a SEPARATE question that depends on what else is dispatched around the
/// declining arm, and residual 2 below is a measured shape where it does NOT.
/// The decline is delivered by a PAIR of guards — one per production on that path
/// that consumes a bare `can't block` as its own predicate and lowers it to one
/// definition. Either guard alone leaves the other's channel open:
///
///  1. `evasion::parse_subject_combat_rule_static` (`dispatch.rs:2261`) applies
///     this marker POSITIONALLY, at the offset its own predicate matched, and
///     declines before attempting the object. It is dispatched FIRST, and its
///     trailing-`unless` fallback would otherwise accept a failed object parse and
///     attach the rider to the inverse blanket restriction (#7454 round 2). The
///     positional application is also what lets a sibling `can't attack` sentence
///     that merely CONTAINS the marker keep the lowering that production gives it
///     — see that function's comment for the mechanism.
///  2. The terminal blanket `can't block` arm in `dispatch.rs` scans the line for
///     this marker. A line-wide scan is tolerable THERE and only there, but the
///     reason is narrower than "it runs after everything that could own such a
///     line": it can only pre-empt an owner dispatched LATER than itself. The two
///     owners of a line that merely CONTAINS the phrase in another clause are both
///     dispatched EARLIER and so are already decided by the time this arm runs — a
///     quoted granted ability (`anthem::parse_subject_continuous_static`,
///     `dispatch.rs:1818`, via `parse_quoted_rule_static_modifications`) and a
///     sibling `can't attack` sentence (guard 1's production, `dispatch.rs:2261`).
///     A LATER-dispatched owner is NOT protected — residual 1. Hoisting a
///     line-wide scan ahead of the combat-rule family instead was measured to
///     break the sibling sentence, which is why guard 1 stays positional.
///
/// The LEADING `"As long as <condition>, "` GATE is handled, not residual:
/// [`parse_gated_symmetric_block_conjunction_static`] strips the gate, delegates
/// the restriction lowering to the bare arm, and attaches the typed condition to
/// both halves, so the multi path binds the same two definitions the bare form
/// does plus the gate. The single-return path declines in the
/// empty-modification fallback when the SPLIT EFFECT CLAUSE carries this marker
/// (`dispatch.rs`, inside the inverted-as-long-as block) — scoped to the effect
/// clause, so the other printed lines that legitimately reach that fallback keep
/// their exact prior lowering. It fails closed when the gate is untypeable
/// (`StaticCondition::Unrecognized` evaluates to `true`, which would apply both
/// restrictions unconditionally) and when the subject is outside
/// `parse_effect_subject_prefix`'s set (a `"Beasts …"` subject fails
/// `split_on_effect_subject_comma`); both cases leave the line honestly
/// unsupported at 0 statics. Covered by
/// `leading_as_long_as_gate_binds_both_halves_with_the_condition` in `tests.rs`.
///
/// The guarantee is NOT a whole-parser invariant. Two measured residuals remain,
/// neither reachable by a printed card (census of `AtomicCards.json`: 8 cards
/// print this phrase — Sneaky Homunculus bare plus 7 quoted Spirit-token grants —
/// none with any rider, any activation tail, any leading gate, or the reversed
/// order), and both predate this production's base:
///
///  1. REVERSED SENTENCE ORDER, single path. Guard 2 pre-empts a later-dispatched
///     owner: `"~ can't block or be blocked by Walls. ~ can't attack unless you
///     control a Wall."` returns `None` from `parse_static_line`, because the
///     terminal `can't block` arm precedes the terminal `can't attack` arm and its
///     line-wide `return None` fires first (same result for a `"Beasts …"`
///     subject). `parse_static_line_multi` still binds all three statics, so there
///     is no card impact.
///  2. ACTIVATION TAIL, multi path. The compound activation-prohibition arm in
///     `parse_static_line_multi_dispatch` ("<subject> … , and [its] activated
///     abilities can't be activated") still derives a bare `CantBlock` for the
///     combat half — from `parse_activation_compound_restriction_modes`, which
///     resolves an attached subject's own predicate and otherwise delegates to
///     `parse_restriction_modes`, and from the arm's own
///     `scan_contains("can't block")` fallback when there is no attached subject —
///     so a marker line carrying that tail still yields the inverse restriction
///     there. Measured: over 825 generated subject × object × rider shapes,
///     `parse_static_line` returns a blanket `CantBlock` for none, while
///     `parse_static_line_multi` returns one for the 165 that carry that tail.
///
/// The marker deliberately stops BEFORE the separating space, and the space
/// lives in the predicate instead. That is load-bearing, not cosmetic: with the
/// space folded into this tag, the object-less `"~ can't block or be blocked
/// by."` fails the marker at every word boundary `scan_preceded` tries, slips
/// past guard 2, and lowers to a blanket `CantBlock` — which is exactly the bug
/// this split exists to prevent.
///
/// Two structural segments (prohibition verb, then conjunction + object head)
/// rather than one flat literal, so a reversed-order or trailing-gate sibling
/// factors onto an existing axis instead of adding a full-line `alt` arm.
///
/// The prohibition verb accepts BOTH the ASCII apostrophe (`can't`) and the

/// rest of the parser already follows (`oracle_trigger.rs`'s `wasn't`/`wasn’t`,

/// RECIPIENT and is left for the recipient grammar; binding it to the
/// Aura/Equipment would gate on a permanent that is never itself tapped or
/// attacking.
///
/// `affected` is `Option` because `StaticDefinition::affected` is: a static with
/// no affected set (`MaxUntapPerType`) is categorically not SelfRef and must not
/// be coerced into a literal it does not carry.
///
/// Authority for that binding decision within the three static-gate helpers
/// `parse_unless_static_condition`, `parse_as_long_as_static_condition` and
/// `parse_if_static_condition`: those route through here and no call site
/// re-decides it. Replaces the ternary formerly duplicated in
/// `parse_continuous_gets_has` (anthem.rs, both the as-long-as and unless arms).
///
/// The claim is deliberately NOT "every affected-bearing static gate", and NOT a
/// complete enumeration of the arms that fall outside it. Review found three
/// that build a SelfRef static and parse its gate with a bare
/// `parse_static_condition`, deciding the binding by omission — `evasion.rs`'s
/// `CanAttackWithDefender` subject arm, and `dispatch.rs`'s
/// `~ has <kw> as long as <cond>` and self-referential type-removal branches.
/// A proximity scan (a `SelfRef` assignment within ~45 lines of a

/// figure is a defensible count. THE COMPLETE SET IS UNMEASURED, as is whether
/// any such arm is REACHABLE with a pronoun gate. Named here so the next change
/// starts from a known-incomplete list it can extend, rather than from a
/// universal that is false.
///
/// PRE-REWRITING CALLERS ARE ENUMERATED, not permitted by predicate.
/// `parse_max_untap_per_type_static` (dispatch.rs) is the ONLY caller allowed to
/// call `rewrite_self_pronoun_subject` before/instead of routing through here,
/// and it always applies the rewrite. That is not an oversight and must not be
/// "fixed" by routing it through this helper. The two are reconciled by scope,
/// not precedence: this helper reads binding off `affected`, and
/// `MaxUntapPerType` never sets `affected` (`StaticDefinition::new` defaults it
/// to `None`), so the helper correctly declines — while that same structural
/// fact, not any rule, is why the static has no attached-subject variant and why
/// its gate is always a state check on the cap's own source.
/// Adding a second pre-rewriting caller requires re-running the census of
/// SelfRef-affected statics first. These are the only two production callers of
/// `rewrite_self_pronoun_subject`.
///
/// NORMALIZATION IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not the caller's job.
/// `rewrite_self_pronoun_subject` matches an EXACT closed list, so a trailing
