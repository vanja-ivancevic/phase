    //    line-wide gate hoisted to the TOP of `parse_static_line_inner` would
    //    endanger it.
    //  * a sibling `can't attack` sentence is owned by THIS VERY PRODUCTION, not
    //    by some other arm: "Beasts can't attack unless you control a Wall. Beasts
    //    can't block or be blocked by Walls." lowers HERE to mode `CantAttack` with
