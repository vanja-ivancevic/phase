//! CR 110.2a battlefield-entry control-clause grammar.
//!
//! One combinator for every printed spelling of the `"under <possessor>
//! control"` clause that trails (or leads) a battlefield destination phrase,
//! plus the CR 608.2c antecedent resolution that turns a third-person anaphor
//! into a bound [`ControllerRef`].
//!
//! CR 110.2a: "If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the
//! battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player's control
//! unless the effect states otherwise." The clause parsed here is precisely the
//! "unless the effect states otherwise" escape, so the grammar and the binding
//! are the authority for who ends up controlling the permanent.
//!
//! CR 110.1 scopes this to battlefield destinations only; a `"to its
//! owner's hand"` phrase has no controller.
//!
//! Before this module the four rewired seams each recognized a *different*
//! hand-picked subset of the spellings by literal comparison, and every
//! third-person form (`"under their control"`, `"under that player's
//! control"`) was silently dropped into the existing no-override carrier. That
//! carrier cannot preserve an explicitly named third-person controller.
//! Collapsing the spellings into one grammar makes the dropped forms either
//! *bound* (when an antecedent is nameable) or *honestly unsupported* (when it
//! is not) — never silently wrong.
