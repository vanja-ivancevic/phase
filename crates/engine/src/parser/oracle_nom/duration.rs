//! Duration combinators for Oracle text parsing.
//!
//! **Single authority for the phrase→`Duration` grammar** (oracle-parser
//! SKILL §7). Parses: "until end of turn", "until end of combat", "until the
//! end of your/their next turn", "until your/their next turn", the
//! `until [the beginning of] <possessor> next <step>` step-deadline family
//! ("until your next end step", "until the next end step", "until your next
//! upkeep", "until its controller's next untap step"), "until ~/this creature
//! leaves the battlefield", "until you exile another card with ~/this
//! ability", "until a player casts <a|an> <filter> spell", "for the rest of
//! the game", "for as long as [condition]", "this turn", "this/that combat",
//! and the "during target opponent's/player's next turn" WINDOW (Gideon Jura).
//!
//! A phrase added here is taken away from every clause-level grammar that owned
//! it, because the positional wrappers below run first — see
//! `parse_next_turn_window_possessor` for why the "during …" arm accepts only
//! the targeted possessives.
//!
//! Positional wrappers (`strip_trailing_duration` / `strip_leading_duration`
//! in `oracle_effect/lower.rs`, the clause shell, and the combat-grant
//! parsers in `oracle_effect/subject.rs`) decide WHERE a duration clause
//! sits; the phrase→variant mapping lives only here. Adding a new duration
