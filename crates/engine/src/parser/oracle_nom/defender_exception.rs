//!
//! `<segment>` — the INTERPOSED SEGMENT — names the class of defenders the
//! permission covers ("players who attacked you during their last turn",
//! CR 508.6). SIX EDITED CALL SITES share this module — productions (a),
//! (b) and (c), the conjunctive static splitter, the continuous compound, and
//! the shared recognition predicate `is_can_attack_despite_defender_predicate`
//! — so the class cannot be supported on one printed shape and misparsed on
//! another. A SEVENTH site, `sequence::combat_requirement_conjunct_prepend`, is
//! UNEDITED and reaches this module through the shared predicate. FIVE of the
//! six EMIT a `CanAttackWithDefender` and therefore call `permission_condition`;
//! the predicate emits nothing.
//!
//! SINGLE CONDITION AUTHORITY: recognition is delegated to
//! `oracle_nom::condition::parse_inner_condition`. This module applies a purely
//! GRAMMATICAL normalization from the relative-clause surface the card prints to
//! the clausal surface the authority owns, and NAMES the class. It holds no
//! condition vocabulary, and a class->condition table here would be a second
//! authority (forbidden by CLAUDE.md).
//!
//! FAIL-CLOSED: a segment the authority declines, or one it recognizes with no
//! defending-player-anchored reading, yields `unenforceable_gate_marker` —
//! permanently inert at runtime AND red in coverage. Never a bare
//! `Unrecognized`, which `layers::evaluate_condition_inner` (layers.rs:2120)
//! reads as TRUE and which would make the PERMISSION apply to every defender.
