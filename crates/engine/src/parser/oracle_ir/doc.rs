//! Document-level Oracle IR types.
//!
//! `OracleDocIr` represents the complete parsed output of a card's Oracle text
//! as a list of `OracleItemIr`. Each item carries a stable `OracleItemId`, an
//! `OracleUnitSource` (byte + line span), and a typed `OracleNodeIr` payload.
//!
//! Items are produced through `OracleDocBuilder`, which is the single authority
//! for item identity, ordering, and span invariants. Nothing constructs an
//! `OracleItemIr` directly.
//!
//! The builder orders items by `(first_line, ordinal)`, and every producer —
//! the dispatch loop and every preprocessor, Class included — emits through
//! `DocEmitter` at the item's printed source line. Items are therefore genuinely
//! source-ordered, and every span is `SpanPrecision::Exact` or the honest
//! chain-local `SpanPrecision::ChainRelative`.

// NOTE ON `dead_code`: suppression in this module is **per item**, never
// module-wide. A module-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` also silences code not yet
// written, and it is precisely what hid two silent defects here during review
// (an `emit` counter that skipped every `PreLowered*` payload, and a
// `validate_child_span` that failed open). Each suppression below names the unit
// that gives the item a production caller, and dies when that unit lands.
