//! Typed per-item semantic feature vocabulary for the swallow audit.
//!
//! The swallow audit asks one question per source unit: *does the Oracle text of
//! this unit raise a semantic expectation that the parsed output for **this same
//! unit** does not represent?* This module owns the vocabulary that question is
//! asked in, and the item-scoped view of the lowered definitions that supplies
//! the evidence half of the answer.
//!
//! # Why the evidence is a *lowered* definition rather than sourced IR
//!
//! Plan 02 step 1 was written expecting to visit `OracleNodeIr::{Spell, Trigger,
//! Static, Replacement}` — the IR-carrying node variants — before lowering
//! discards their nested provenance. Those four variants have **no production
//! constructors**: every item the dispatch loop emits is a `PreLowered*` node
//! carrying an already-lowered engine definition (`DocEmitter` in `oracle.rs` is
//! the only emitter, and it emits nothing else). There is no sourced IR to visit,
//! so the audit visits the lowered definition that the item actually produced.
//!
//! # Why the audit runs *after* the relation passes
//!
//! Pre-lowering auditing is blind to relation-synthesized semantics; the
//! false-positive wave U1 bounded to 31 faces would be caused, not avoided.
//! `apply_linked_choice_etb_counter` **synthesizes a replacement**, so an audit
//! running ahead of it would report that replacement as swallowed on exactly the
//! cross-item cards the relations exist to model. The audit therefore runs at its
//! pinned post-relation position, and resolves each definition back to its owning
//! item through the parallel `_ids` tracks `lower_oracle_ir` already maintains.
//!
//! Those tracks stay index-aligned with their category vectors across the relation
//! passes: of the four passes that run before the audit, three are
//! length-preserving and the fourth (`apply_linked_choice_etb_counter`) removes
//! from `result.replacements` and `replacement_ids` at the same index. So
//! `result.<category>[k]` ↔ `<category>_ids[k]` is a sound zip at the audit point,
//! which is what [`scope_to_item`] relies on.
//!
//! # Granularity
//!
//! Every unit audited here is an item's **header unit** (`ordinal == 0`), which is
//! document-unique and carries an `Exact` span. Sub-item units (two clauses on one
//! line; mode A vs mode B inside one modal item) are **not** expressible today:
//! `ClauseIrBuilder` mints its clause ids against a fresh, throwaway
//! `OracleDocBuilder`, so every chain restarts at `OracleItemId(0)` and clause
//! `OracleUnitId`s are not document-unique. Restoring sub-item granularity is the
//! recognizer bring-up plan's job.
