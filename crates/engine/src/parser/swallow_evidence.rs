//! Typed evidence probe over one audit unit's lowered definitions.
//!
//! The swallow audit asks, per source unit: *does this unit's Oracle text raise a
//! semantic expectation that this unit's parse does not represent?* This module owns
//! the **evidence half** of that question — "is a carrier for semantic S present in
//! the parse?" — and answers it with a **typed** `match`, not a substring scan.
//!
//! # Why this exists: a string marker is not checked by anything
//!
//! The audit previously answered every tree-global evidence question by scanning the
//! serialized AST text for representation markers — a raw substring search for, say,
//! the marker `ConditionMet`. Nothing checks a string. A marker naming a type that does not exist compiles,
//! runs, and silently never matches; a marker that is a *substring of a longer type
//! name* compiles, runs, and silently matches the **wrong rule's fact**. Both were
//! present, and the second is the dangerous one — it fails CLOSED, suppressing true
//! positives:
//!
//! | marker (as written) | what it actually matched | pool hits |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ConditionMet` | `TriggerCondition::SolveConditionMet` — a CR 719 Case **solve** condition | 15/15 |
//! | `AsLongAs` | `Duration::ForAsLongAs` | — |
//! | `ManaValue` | `CastPermissionConstraint::ManaValue` (a cast gate, not a quantity) | — |
//! | `Causative`, `HaveCausative`, `HaveItVerb`, `ConditionalEffect`, `ConditionalStatic` | nothing — they name no type in the engine | 0 |
//!
//! There is no `ConditionMet` variant anywhere in the engine. So a `Condition_If`
//! expectation ("is this card's `if` represented?") was being discharged by the
//! presence of an unrelated rule's fact, on every card carrying a Case. The compiler
//! could not object, because to the compiler it was a string.
//!
//! Typed evidence removes the channel: `matches!(c, AbilityCondition::QuantityCheck { .. })`
//! either names a real variant or does not compile.
//!
//! # How total reach is achieved without hand-enumerating the type closure
//!
//! The facts these detectors need are **tree-global existence** facts ("is there a
//! dynamic quantity *anywhere* under this unit's definitions?"). Their typed carriers
//! span a 187-type forward closure (187 types transitively reach `QuantityExpr`;
//! `Effect` alone has 224 variants), so a hand-written total walk would be thousands
//! of arms — every one of which is a silent reach gap if forgotten, and a missed
//! carrier is a **false positive wave**, not a compile error.
//!
//! Instead the probe walks the `serde_json::Value` the definitions already serialize
//! to and attempts `T::deserialize` on each node. Reach is therefore **serde-derived**
//! — the compiler maintains it — while the predicate stays typed Rust. Adding a new
//! `Effect` variant that carries a `QuantityExpr` extends the probe's reach for free.
//!
//! # Soundness: what a node deserializing as `T` does and does NOT prove
//!
//! Ruling (B) was accepted on the premise that "a false deserialize is structurally
//! impossible". That is **not literally true**, and the module is built to the weaker,
//! accurate statement. Two distinct hazards:
//!
//! **(1) Externally tagged enums.** `Duration` and `StaticMode` are NOT `#[serde(tag =
//! "type")]`. Their unit variants serialize as **bare strings** (`"UntilEndOfTurn"`,
//! `"Permanent"`). An unanchored `any::<Duration>` would therefore match *any string
//! anywhere* that happens to equal a variant name — and `"Permanent"` is a common
//! string in this tree (card kinds, filters). These two types MUST be probed with
//! [`UnitEvidence::any_at`], which anchors on the JSON key the carrier field actually
//! uses. See [`DURATION_KEYS`] / [`STATIC_MODE_KEYS`].
//!
//! **(2) Shared variant names between internally tagged enums.** An internally tagged
//! enum is often assumed to be self-identifying, so that anchoring is needed only for the
//! externally tagged types in hazard (1). **That assumption is false**, for two compounding
//! reasons:
//!
//!   * an internally-tagged **unit** variant matches on the `type` field ALONE, and serde
//!     **ignores unknown fields** by default — so a node carrying extra fields still
//!     deserializes cleanly, with those fields silently dropped;
//!   * a tag only discriminates if the variant NAME is unique across every tagged enum in
//!     the tree. It is not.
//!
//! For `QuantityRef` alone — 84 variants, against the 161 `tag = "type"` enums in `types/`
//! (the true population; an earlier count of 91 was short, which is how the `FilterProp`
//! collision below went unlisted until it suppressed Siren's Call) — 10 names are shared:
//!
//! ```text
//! QuantityRef ∩ AbilityCondition         = {PreviousEffectAmount}
//! QuantityRef ∩ FilterProp               = {AttackedThisTurn, EnteredThisTurn}
//! QuantityRef ∩ TriggerCondition         = {AttackedThisTurn, CounterAddedThisTurn}
//! QuantityRef ∩ ParsedCondition          = {BattlefieldEntriesThisTurn}
//! QuantityRef ∩ ChooseFromZoneConstraint = {DistinctCardTypes}
//! QuantityRef ∩ ManaCost                 = {SelfManaValue}
//! QuantityRef ∩ ManaProduction           = {} (was {DistinctColorsAmongPermanents}
//!                                          until the QuantityRef side was renamed
//!                                          to DistinctColorsAmong; the two enums no
//!                                          longer share a variant name)
//! QuantityRef ∩ SolveCondition           = {ObjectCount}
//! QuantityRef ∩ QuantityExpr             = {Power}
//! ```
//!
//! and elsewhere in the probed set:
//!
//! ```text
//! Effect                 ∩ AbilityCondition      = {CastFromZone}
//! Effect                 ∩ StaticMode            = {RevealHand}
//! AbilityCondition       ∩ StaticCondition       = {And, Not, Or, SourceMatchesFilter, …17}
//! StaticCondition        ∩ ActivationRestriction = {DuringYourTurn, SourceIsHarnessed}
//! ContinuousModification ∩ StaticMode            = {AssignNoCombatDamage}
//! ```
//!
//! A node bearing a shared name can deserialize as *either* enum. That is only a defect if
//! a predicate's ANSWER differs across the collision — so the safety argument has to be made
//! per predicate, and it is:
//!   * `QuantityExpr::Power` and `QuantityRef::Power` are BOTH dynamic quantities, so that
//!     collision cannot change a `DynamicQty` answer;
//!   * the `AbilityCondition`/`StaticCondition` 17-way overlap is asked only as "*a*
//!     condition slot is populated", a question whose answer is the same for both;
//!   * no predicate matches `CastFromZone`, `RevealHand`, `AssignNoCombatDamage`,
//!     `DuringYourTurn` or `SourceIsHarnessed`.
//!
//! **This argument was once made for the quantity probes too, and it was WRONG.** The
//! `PreviousEffectAmount` collision above was known and listed, under the claim "no predicate
//! matches it". But `detect_dynamic_qty` probed `any::<QuantityRef>(|_| true)` — and `|_| true`
//! is the ONE predicate that cannot be insensitive to a collision, because it matches every
//! variant by construction. The consequence was measured over the full 35,396-face pool:
//! Boing!'s `AbilityCondition::PreviousEffectAmount` (under key `condition`) and Siren's Call's
//! `FilterProp::AttackedThisTurn` (under key `properties[].prop`, a TARGET FILTER) were both
//! read as dynamic quantities, silently suppressing two true swallowed-clause warnings. The
//! `FilterProp` collision was not even in the old table — the table had been computed against
//! too small a set of enums.
//!
//! So the rule is now structural rather than argued: **`QuantityRef` and `QuantityExpr` are
//! probed KEY-ANCHORED** ([`QUANTITY_KEYS`]), exactly like the externally tagged types. A value
//! reached through a quantity key IS a quantity by construction, so no collision is reachable.
//! Prefer anchoring to a per-predicate soundness argument wherever a key set exists: the
//! argument has to be re-derived every time a predicate or an enum changes, and nothing checks
//! it. **Anchoring fails LOUD** (a missing key over-reports, and the full-pool delta shows it);
//! **an unanchored probe fails QUIET** (it under-reports, and nothing shows it).
//!
//! # The collision map, and the per-site verdicts (task #51)
//!
//! POPULATION FIRST, because the earlier version of this table was wrong by omission: it was
//! computed against **91** enums and therefore reported 13 colliding predicates. Regenerated
//! against the true population — **162** tagged enums in `types/` (93 internally tagged
//! `tag = "type"`, 69 adjacently tagged `tag = "type", content = "data"`), 1,475 variant names,
//! of which **200 are shared by more than one enum** — the same probes yield **19** colliding
//! (site, variant) pairs across 10 sites. All 13 previously listed reproduce; 6 were missed.
//! A collision table is a claim about a population: if the population is short, the table's
//! ABSENCES are worthless. Regenerate it, do not trust it.
//!
//! The generator is ~40 lines of python over `types/*.rs`: parse every `tag = "type"` enum's
//! variants, record unit-vs-struct AND internal-vs-adjacent, invert to `name -> [owning enums]`,
//! keep the names owned by more than one enum, then intersect with the variants each
//! `evidence.any::<T>()` predicate actually matches. Re-run it whenever a probe or an enum
//! changes: these numbers are a measurement, not a constant (they moved by one enum between
//! the audit and the rebase, without changing any verdict).
//!
//! Two mechanisms, and they are NOT the same:
//!   * **internally tagged** — a UNIT variant matches on the `type` field alone and serde drops
//!     unknown sibling fields, so any node bearing that tag deserializes. Widest surface.
//!   * **adjacently tagged** — the payload sits under `data`, so a struct variant will not
//!     deserialize without it. Narrower, but NOT safe: two adjacently tagged enums sharing a
//!     variant name AND a payload shape are freely interchangeable (see
//!     [`ACTIVATION_RESTRICTION_KEYS`]).
//!
//! **A struct variant is not automatically safe.** `Effect::CastFromZone` has nine fields and
//! every one carries `#[serde(default)]`, so serde matches it on the tag alone — it is a unit
//! variant in effect. Always check for a REQUIRED field before believing "struct, so it can't
//! collide".
//!
//! ## ANCHORED — the collision changes the detector's ANSWER
//!
//! ```text
//! any::<Effect>                CastFromZone       also: AbilityCondition, ReplacementCondition
//! any::<ActivationRestriction> RequiresCondition  also: CastingRestriction (field-identical)
//! ```
//!
//! Both are now key-anchored ([`EFFECT_KEYS`], [`ACTIVATION_RESTRICTION_KEYS`]) and both are
//! pinned by a differential guard test that was observed RED before it was made green.
//!
//! MEASURED over the full 35,396-face pool: the collision surface is POPULATED — 36
//! `CastFromZone` nodes sit under non-effect keys (`condition` ×25, `inner` ×9, `conditions`
//! ×2) and 34 `RequiresCondition` nodes sit under `casting_restrictions`. Every one of those 70
//! nodes was being accepted by the unanchored probe as the WRONG enum. The swallow delta is
//! nevertheless **0 gains / 0 losses**, because both are currently MASKED by an upstream text
//! gate, not by any property of the probe:
//!   * 32 of the 35 `CastFromZone` cards contain no "this turn" at all, so the detector never
//!     reaches the probe; the other 3 are dissolved by an earlier leg either way;
//!   * the activation gate demands that EVERY "this turn" occurrence sit on an "activate only"
//!     line, and a card carrying a *casting* restriction ("cast only if ...") does not say
//!     "activate only" — so the gate rejects it before the probe runs.
//!
//! That is luck, not safety: it holds only while no printed card pairs a cast-zone CONDITION
//! with a dropped "this turn", or an "activate only ... this turn" with a casting restriction.
//! Anchoring makes the answer correct by construction and costs nothing (byte-identical export).
//!
//! ## ANSWER-EQUIVALENT — left unanchored, with the reason each is collision-INVARIANT
//!
//! 8 sites / 17 pairs remain probed unanchored. Each is safe for a stated, CHECKABLE reason —
//! not a vibe, and not "it's a specific variant so it must be fine" (that claim is false, see
//! above). Anchoring them would be WRONG: it would risk removing evidence that is accidentally
//! load-bearing (exactly what anchoring the quantity probes did to `ManaProduction`, which then
//! had to be restored as a typed leg).
//!
//! **(a) The turn-scope disjunction** — sites probing `ParsedCondition`, `StaticCondition`,
//! `AbilityCondition`, `TriggerCondition`, `FilterProp` inside the `Duration_ThisTurn` detector
//! (14 of the 17 pairs). The detector asks ONE existential question — *does this unit carry any
//! turn-scoped carrier?* — as a disjunction across seven enums. **Every variant it matches has
//! `ThisTurn` in its name**, and a collision is by definition NAME IDENTITY, so whichever enum a
//! colliding node is read as, it still bears a `ThisTurn` name and is still a turn-scoped
//! carrier. The disjunction is CLOSED under its own collision set, so the answer cannot change.
//! Checkable in one grep: every variant named by those five `matches!` arms contains `ThisTurn`.
//!
//! **(b) `any::<ManaCost>` / `SelfManaValue`** (also `QuantityRef::SelfManaValue`). The question
//! is "is there a value derived from the card's OWN mana cost rather than a fixed amount?"
//! (CR 106.1). Both readings are exactly that — a self-referential dynamic value — so the
//! answer is identical under either.
//!
//! **(c) `any::<AbilityCondition>` / `any::<StaticCondition>` on `Not`.** The two are already
//! OR'd together at the call site, so those two readings are answer-identical BY CONSTRUCTION.
//! `Not` is also a variant of `FilterProp` and `TargetFilter`, but those are
//! `Not { prop }` / `Not { filter }` — the field NAME differs from `Not { condition }`, so
//! neither can deserialize as a condition. The collision is structurally impossible, not merely
//! unlikely.
//!
//! The collision that motivated this module — `ConditionMet` vs `SolveConditionMet` —
//! is NOT in any table above, because the names differ. That is precisely the property a
//! type has and a substring does not.
//!
//! # The `description` channel (cond-1)
//!
//! `description` fields carry raw Oracle prose. Deserializing prose as a semantic
//! carrier is the same defect one layer down, so [`UnitEvidence`] **never descends
//! into a `description` value**. The walk is the single choke point, so no probe —
//! present or future — can read prose as evidence.
