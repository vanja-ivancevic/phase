//! Architectural rule: the parser must never silently discard Oracle text.
//!
//! Every clause in Oracle text must either be represented in the parsed AST,
//! OR cause the line to fail and yield `Effect::Unimplemented` carrying the
//! original phrase. Anything in between is a parser lie.
//!
//! This module audits each card's parsed `ParsedAbilities` against its
//! original Oracle text and emits a `parse_warning` for every swallow marker
//! that has no AST representation. Findings surface in the coverage report
//! via `CardFace::parse_warnings`.
//!
//! Phase 1 (this commit): observability only — warnings, no semantic changes.
//! Once detector noise is calibrated, Phase 2 will demote affected abilities
//! to `Effect::Unimplemented`.
//!
//! Detectors are intentionally conservative. Each one:
//!   1. Scans the lower-cased Oracle text (with parenthesized reminder text
//!      stripped) for a marker phrase.
//!   2. Inspects the parsed `ParsedAbilities` directly for the corresponding
//!      AST representation.
//!   3. Emits a warning ONLY when the marker is present and the AST has no
//!      representation.

// ── Duration evidence: one typed channel, plus two non-`Duration` carriers ───────────────
//
// Three vacuous helpers used to live here — `def_tree_has_duration`, `any_ability_has_duration`
// and `static_has_duration`. All are DELETED. The third is why:
//
//     fn static_has_duration(s: &StaticDefinition) -> bool { let _ = s; true }
//
// It returned `true` for ANY static ability whatsoever — a keyword grant, an anthem, a cost
// modifier — so `any_ability_has_duration` (its only caller, and the sole evidence gate on
// `detect_duration_until_eot`) was discharged by the mere EXISTENCE of a static.
// `StaticDefinition` has no `Duration` field at all; a static's duration lives on the
// `Effect::GenericEffect` that wraps it. The stub was not a conservative approximation of a
// duration — it was unrelated to one. `any_ability_has_duration` compounded it by accepting a
// duration of ANY KIND: a `Permanent` grant satisfied an "until end of turn" expectation.
// Evidence must be the fact the expectation asked about (CR 611.2a).
//
// A hand-written typed walk replaced them, and was in turn replaced by the serde probe in
// `swallow_evidence`. The reason is worth keeping, because it is the argument for the probe:
// a hand-enumerated carrier list is a CLAIM ABOUT A POPULATION, and that claim was falsified
// twice in review — first by `ManaSpellGrant::AddKeywordUntilEndOfTurn.duration` (a
// `Box<Duration>`, fully qualified, in `mana.rs`), then by durations nested under
// `Effect::Token.static_abilities -> GrantTrigger -> trigger.execute`. Each miss surfaced as a
// false-positive warning cluster. `UnitEvidence::any_duration` derives its reach from serde
// instead of from a human, so it structurally cannot miss a `Duration`-typed carrier.
//
// THE PROBE'S REACH IS A TYPE, NOT A CONCEPT. It finds values of type `Duration`. Two carriers
// express an end-of-turn scope WITHOUT being a `Duration`, so they are outside it BY
// CONSTRUCTION and keep the typed legs below — no widening of `any_duration` can subsume them:
//
//   1. `Effect::Mana.expiry` (`ManaExpiry`, CR 106.4) — "that mana doesn't empty until end of
//      turn". A different TYPE.
//   2. `ReplacementEvent::DamageDone` (CR 614.6 + CR 514.2) — a one-shot damage shield has no

/// marker). Extracted so the list can't drift across the three call sites.

/// suppression must not treat it as a dynamic marker. Two surface forms qualify:
/// "Activate ... twice each turn" (CR 602.5b usage-limited activation) and

/// "twice each turn" is accepted on wording alone. "rather than once" is NOT:

/// unit that actually lowers it to a fixed-count limit is
/// `StaticMode::ModifyActivationLimit` (the "can boast N times/twice/thrice ...
/// rather than once" combinator in `oracle_static/dispatch.rs`). Wording alone
/// is therefore not a reliable signal for that arm: an unsupported future
/// clause could reuse the same "rather than once" idiom without producing that
/// typed carrier, and would wrongly have its DynamicQty marker suppressed if
/// the text shape were trusted by itself. The "rather than once" arm keys off
/// the wording only as a LOCATOR and additionally requires the scoped unit's
/// `evidence` to contain a `StaticMode::ModifyActivationLimit` before
/// suppressing the marker — with no typed carrier present, the "rather than
/// once" wording is treated as a live dynamic-quantity marker instead. "twice
/// that many" / "twice X" remain real dynamic-quantity multipliers and are

    // where anchoring removed a fact that was accidentally load-bearing.
