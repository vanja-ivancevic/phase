///    sequence ("Tap target creature. It doesn't untap"; "When ~ enters, choose

///    that `game::filter::pt_value_from_pair`'s `power.unwrap_or(0)` turns into
///    "no enchantment is ever a legal target". CR 208.1 + CR 208.3: power and
///    toughness are creature characteristics; a noncreature has none, so the
///    restriction belongs on the creature disjunct wherever it sits in the list.
///    This ordering is not hypothetical — March of Otherworldly Light
///    ("artifact, creature, or enchantment with mana value X or less") shows
///    WotC writes `creature` mid-list.
///
/// 2. WHY THE WITNESS IS `==` AND NOT `same_kind`. `FilterProp::same_kind` is
///    discriminant-only, so the push loop's dedupe suppresses a *different
///    payload* prop of the same variant. For
///    `Or[Creature{Pt(Toughness,GE,2)}, Enchantment{Pt(Power,GE,4)}]` the
///    harvested `Pt(Power,GE,4)` is never pushed onto the creature leg. A sweep
///    conditioned merely on "some gate-accepted leg exists" would then DELETE a
///    printed restriction that was never rehomed. So the sweep witnesses per
///    prop on exact equality: strip `P` only when a gate-ACCEPTED sibling leg
///    actually carries a `Q == P` (see `pt_hosting_leg_props` for why the host
///    predicate is the gate's complement and not
///    `type_filter_guarantees_creature`).
///
/// 3. FLATTENING PRECONDITION. This sweep runs from
///    `distribute_properties_to_or`, which `parse_type_phrase_with_ctx` invokes
///    on EVERY separator merge, not once at the top. For
///    "creature, artifact, or enchantment with power 4 or greater" the inner
///    merge yields `Or[Artifact{}, Enchantment{Pt}]` — every leg is gate-
///    rejected, so the witness set is empty and the sweep correctly no-ops
///    there; the relocation happens on the OUTER merge,
///    and only because `oracle_util::merge_or_filters` splices a nested `Or`'s
///    legs into the parent, keeping the leg list flat so the enchantment leg is
///    still visible at depth 1. If `merge_or_filters` ever stopped flattening,
///    this sweep would silently stop relocating (a no-op, never a deletion).
///
/// 4. DEPTH-1-ONLY SCOPE, BENIGN FAILURE DIRECTION. Both the harvest `find_map`
///    and this sweep match only `TargetFilter::Typed` at depth 1; a non-`Typed`
///    leg (e.g. the `And[StackSpell, Typed]` shape from `stack_spell_filter`) is
///    invisible to both. Such a leg is neither pushed to nor stripped, so a
///    restriction can never be deleted by a shape the sweep cannot see.
///
/// 5. INVARIANT. Every strip is conditioned on a live, EQUAL witness in the same
///    `Or`. The three non-rehomed cases — no gate-accepted leg, a `same_kind`
///    payload collision, or a non-`Typed` host — all resolve to "keep the prop".

/// path removes or absorbs the clause first:
///
/// 1. Inline token specs — `oracle_effect::token` scans word boundaries for the
///    `that's|that is|that are` + `tapped and attacking|attacking` clause and
///    TRUNCATES the token body at that byte offset; the trailing "that player"
///    is discarded with the clause.
/// 2. Battlefield-entry tails — `parse_battlefield_entry_qualifiers` matches
///    " tapped and attacking" and its qualifier boundary absorbs the trailing
///    player phrase; only `(enter_tapped, enters_attacking)` flags come back.
/// 3. Continuation sentences ("It/The token enters tapped and attacking that
///    player.") — dispatched at sentence level in `oracle_effect::sequence` into
///    a continuation that patches the PRECEDING effect's flags. No filter built.
/// 4. Copy-token modifiers — `parse_copy_token_entry_modifiers` consumes
///    "tapped and attacking " as a `value(...)` tag before the noun.
///
/// Predicative state-change sentences (Portal Manipulator "Those creatures are
