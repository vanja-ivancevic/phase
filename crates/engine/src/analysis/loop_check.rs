//! Engine A — the **dynamic loop-confirmation** entry point.
//!
//! PR-0 gave the [`ResourceVector`] (the monotone axes a loop can pump) and
//! [`loop_states_equal_modulo_resources`] (board/zones/tap-state equal, resources
//! allowed to differ). PR-1 gave [`crate::analysis::LoopProbe`], which drives a
//! `GameRunner` and measures the per-iteration [`ResourceVector`] delta. This
//! module is the classifier that turns those two measurements into a
//! [`LoopCertificate`].
//!
//! # What "detection" means here
//!
//! [`detect_loop`] is the offline classifier: given two driven states plus a
//! per-cycle delta it answers "what resource is unbounded and how does this loop
//! win?" It is called by analysis code and the corpus test harness on a *driven*
//! `GameRunner`.
//!
//! [`live_mandatory_loop_winner`] couples that classifier into the live reducer
//! (`game::engine::reconcile_terminal_result`, CR 732.2a / CR 704.5a): at an
//! all-mandatory cascade whose board has returned identical modulo monotone resources
//! (and the volatile stack id, see `resource::project_out_resources`) while exactly
//! one opponent's life drains without bound, it shortcuts to the forced loss instead
//! of halting on the resource ceiling. PR-3 (Option C) scans a persisted bounded ring
//! of post-resolution snapshots (`GameState::loop_detect_ring`), maintained at the
//! post-pipeline frame of `game::engine::pass_priority_once_with_pipeline` (after
//! `run_post_action_pipeline` places refilling triggers, CR 603.3) and scanned at the
//! single SBA-reconciliation seam — so the win path
//! fires LIVE under the default per-beat `apply(PassPriority)` drive (the production
//! frontend default), which runs `reconcile_terminal_result` after every beat. Note
//! `run_auto_pass_loop` does NOT call `reconcile_terminal_result` inside its internal
//! iterations, so its net-progress grind still runs to the natural CR 704.5a death;
//! the per-beat drive is the accelerated path. So `detect_loop` IS now reached from
//! the reducer via that
//! helper. The strict CR 104.4b / CR 732.4 mandatory-DRAW path (a repeat with no net
//! progress) and the `emit_resolution_halt` runaway backstop are unchanged — the live
//! win path is strictly additive and fires only when life strictly advances toward a
//! single determinate opponent loss.
//!
//! # The detection rule (CR 732.2a — the shortcut, not the draw)
//!
//! A confirmed net-progress loop is exactly the pair of conditions PR-0 built:
//!
//! 1. **Same board** — [`loop_states_equal_modulo_resources`] holds between the
//!    state at the start of a cycle and the state at the end (controller, zone,
//!    tap-state, attachments, object count, stack, phase, priority all identical;
//!    only the monotone resources may differ). This is the *complement* of the
//!    strict CR 104.4b equality the live draw path uses.
//! 2. **Net progress** — the per-cycle [`ResourceVector::delta`] satisfies
//!    [`ResourceVector::is_net_progress`] (≥1 axis strictly increased and no
//!    *consumed* axis — mana, life — went net-negative).
//!
//! When both hold, the loop is repeatable without bound (CR 732.2a: a shortcut
//! that "repeats a specified number of times"), and [`detect_loop`] returns a
//! [`LoopCertificate`] naming the unbounded axes ([`ResourceVector::unbounded_components`])
//! and the derived [`WinKind`]. When either fails, it returns `None` — the
//! soundness guarantee: no certificate for a non-loop or a non-progressing cycle.

/// * CR 508.1h / CR 509.1d put the declaration's COSTS in a separate sub-step
///   ("Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents,

///   paid with 2 life (CR 107.4f) — measured in-code: `engine_combat::handle_pay_combat_tax`

///   `WaitingFor::CombatTaxPayment` — which is deliberately NOT a member and therefore
///   clears the ring.
/// * `AssignCombatDamage` / `AssignBlockerDamage` are likewise NOT members despite being
///   turn-based (CR 510.1c / CR 510.1d): CR 510.2 deals the assigned damage with no
