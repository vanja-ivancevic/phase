//! Engine B — the **static ability-graph extractor** (offline candidate generator).
//!
//! This module is **purely additive** and changes no game behavior. It never
//! calls `apply()`, never drives a `GameRunner`, and never touches a
//! `GameState`. Given a list of card faces it builds a directed
//! ability/resource graph, finds strongly-connected components (Tarjan SCC),
//! and emits **candidate cycles** whose summed per-cycle [`ResourceVector`] is
//! *coverable* (net-progress: ≥1 axis strictly up — or unbounded-up — with no
//! controller-side consumed axis net-negative unless that axis is unbounded-up).
//!
//! It is the over-approximate, fast, card-list stage of the two-engine combo
//! detector: Engine B (here) *proposes* candidates; Engine A
//! ([`crate::analysis::detect_loop`], already shipped) is the sound, stateful
//! stage that *confirms* them by driving the reducer. A candidate is
//! **unconfirmed by construction** — it ignores targeting legality, timing
//! windows, "may" choices, and replacement interactions — so it is a
//! [`CandidateCycle`], deliberately **never** a [`crate::analysis::LoopCertificate`]
//! (whose soundness invariant requires a driven board-equality proof).
//!
//! Theory references (CS, not CR): Tarjan SCC for cycle finding; Karp–Miller /
//! Petri-net coverability for the net-progress test (see
//! `FEASIBILITY-AND-PLAN.md` §3).
//!
//! # PR-4a scope
//!
//! Five priority effect families are modeled — **mana** (CR 106.1), **counters**
//! (CR 122.1), **damage** (CR 120.1 / CR 704.5a), **tap/untap** (CR 701.26a/b),
//! and **cast/copy** (CR 601.2a). Every other [`Effect`] variant projects to
//! [`Projection::Unmodeled`] (contributes nothing) via an exhaustive no-wildcard
//! `match`, so a newly-added variant is a compile error until classified — the
//! same drift gate the four classifiers below share (precedent:
//! `FeatureSupport`, `game/coverage.rs`). Remaining effect families, the life
//! axis, and broader trigger-edge breadth land in PR-4b.
