//! Offline game-state analysis used by the infinite-combo detector.
//!
//! This module owns MEASUREMENT and mutates no `GameState`; the reducer is what
//! reads it — to mint a loop-shortcut offer, to bound that offer, and to bound it
//! again where the accepted proposal is spent. So a change here can move game
//! behavior even though nothing here writes a board. It provides the measurement
//! substrate the net-progress loop detector is built on:
//!
//! - [`ResourceVector`] — a snapshot/delta of the *monotone* resources a loop
//!   can pump (mana, life, damage, library size, tokens, draws, triggers,
//!   counters, …). See [`resource`].
//! - [`loop_states_equal_modulo_resources`] — the **complement** of the existing
//!   strict CR 104.4b loop equality (`types::game_state::loop_states_equal`):
//!   board/zones/tap-state must be identical, but the monotone resources are
//!   allowed to differ. This is what distinguishes a *net-progress* (CR 732.2)
//!   loop from a *mandatory-draw* (CR 104.4b) loop.
//!
//! The strict comparison treats differing life/damage/counters as different
//! states (correct for a mandatory loop → draw). The detector needs the inverse:
//! "same board, resources may differ" → a beneficial loop that should be
//! shortcut (CR 732.2a) rather than drawn (CR 104.4b / CR 732.4).
//!
//! - [`sim`] — the offline simulation harness ([`LoopProbe`] / [`accumulate_events`])
//!   that drives `GameRunner::act` and *feeds* the event-fed `ResourceVector`
//!   axes (damage, tokens, draws, casts, triggers) from the runner's event
//!   stream, which a single `GameState` snapshot cannot supply.
//! - [`loop_check`] — Engine A: [`detect_loop`] turns a same-board-plus-net-progress
//!   measurement into a [`LoopCertificate`] (the unbounded axes + a [`WinKind`]),
//!   the offline classification the corpus harness asserts against. Still
//!   **zero gameplay change** — never called from the reducer.
//! - [`ability_graph`] — Engine B: [`candidate_cycles`] is the static, offline
//!   candidate generator. From a list of `CardFace` ASTs it builds an
//!   ability/resource graph, finds SCCs, and emits over-approximate
//!   [`CandidateCycle`]s for Engine A to confirm. Like the rest of this module it
//!   is **purely additive** — it never drives the reducer and never touches a
//!   `GameState`.
