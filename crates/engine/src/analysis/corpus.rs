//! Shared combo-corpus harness: the 54-row acceptance corpus + the bespoke driver
//! toolkit, parameterized on a `&CardDatabase` so BOTH the `#[cfg(test)]`
//! acceptance suite (`corpus_tests`) and the `combo-verify` CLI drive ONE shared
//! implementation. Gated `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "combo-verify"))]`, so it is
//! excluded from the shipped lib / WASM surface (no game behavior change).
//!
//! Zero game logic lives here: every loop is confirmed by the EXISTING detector
//! (`detect_loop` for offline combos, the per-beat `apply(PassPriority)` reducer +
//! `live_mandatory_loop_winner` §3 shortcut for the two live drain cascades). The
//! CLI is a thin formatter over [`drive_row`]; the engine owns all detection.
//!
//! The single test-only dependency the old `#[cfg(test)] mod corpus_tests` carried
//! (`card_db()` → `test_support::shared_card_db()`, a `#![cfg(test)]` module) is
//! removed here by threading `db: &CardDatabase` through every driver. The
//! `#[cfg(test)]` tests pass the committed fixture; the CLI passes the full export.
