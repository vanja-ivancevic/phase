//! Offline analysis simulation harness around [`GameRunner::act`].
//!
//! PR-0 gave us [`ResourceVector`], whose **state-readable** axes (mana, life,
//! library size, counters) [`ResourceVector::snapshot`] fills directly out of a
//! `GameState`. Its **event-fed** axes — damage dealt, tokens created, cards
//! drawn, casts, landfall/combat/extra-turn counts, the `*_triggers`, and
//! `generic_triggers` — are events, not totals a single `GameState` retains, so
//! `snapshot` leaves them at `Default`.
//!
//! This module is the substrate that *feeds* those event-fed axes. Each
//! `GameRunner::act` returns an `ActionResult { events, .. }` — the game-event
//! stream produced by that action's resolution. [`LoopProbe`] wraps a
//! `GameRunner`, accumulates those events into a running [`ResourceVector`] as
//! actions are driven, and takes a state-readable `snapshot` at iteration
//! boundaries. The per-iteration [`ResourceVector::delta`] it produces therefore
//! has *both* halves populated — the measurement a CR 732.2a net-progress
//! detector (PR-2) consumes.
//!
//! It is **purely offline / additive**: it only *observes* the runner. It never
//! mutates game state, never alters resolution, SBAs, or the reducer, and emits
//! no game events of its own. The detector hook itself is PR-2.
