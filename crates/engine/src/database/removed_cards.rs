//! Build-time exclusion of cards Wizards of the Coast officially removed and
//! banned in every format for racist or culturally offensive depictions (2020
//! announcement). These names are dropped from every generated artifact — the
//! card database and the precon deck listings — so they never surface in
//! search, deckbuilding, coverage, or gameplay.
//!
//! `Crusade` was deliberately removed from this list: it is a white-weenie
//! staple in the premodern old-border deck pool, and every card in that pool
//! must be playable. The remaining names stay excluded.
//!
//! This is data-pipeline tooling, not game-rules logic, so no Comprehensive
//! Rules annotations apply.

/// Officially-removed card names, lowercased for case-insensitive EXACT
/// matching. Exact match is mandatory: a substring match on "imprison" or
/// "cleanse" would wrongly drop legitimate cards such as "Imprisoned in the
/// Moon" and "Suncleanser".
