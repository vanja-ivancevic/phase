//! Hideaway (CR 702.75) — ETB look-and-exile-face-down keyword.
//!
//! CR 702.75a: "Hideaway N" is a triggered ability that means "When this
//! permanent enters, look at the top N cards of your library. Exile one of them
//! face down and put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
//! The exiled card gains 'The player who controls the permanent that exiled this
//! card may look at this card in the exile zone.'"
//!
//! Older printings used "Hideaway" (Hideaway 4); since *Murders at Karlov Manor*
//! the keyword is parameterized ("Hideaway N"). Either way the ability is only
//! represented on the card as the `Keyword::Hideaway(N)` tag plus reminder text
//! (which the parser strips), so without synthesis it is a silent no-op — and
//! the card's companion "you may play the exiled card …" ability (already parsed
//! and handled in `game/casting.rs`) has nothing to reference. This module is
//! the prerequisite link: it establishes the face-down exiled card.
//!
//! Built from existing building blocks — no bespoke interactive choice:
//!
//! 1. `Effect::Dig` (look at top N, choose one to keep, rest to bottom of
//!    library) handles the look + interactive selection + "rest on the bottom"
//!    via the fully-wired `WaitingFor::DigChoice` flow. The kept card's
//!    destination is `Exile`; the `DigChoice` resolution binds the chosen
//!    (exiled) card onto the continuation's targets.
//! 2. `Effect::HideawayConceal` (chained as a `sub_ability`, CR 608.2c) takes
//!    that exiled card — `TargetFilter::ParentTarget` — and turns it face down
//!    while linking it to the source via the `exile_links` pool, so the
//!    companion ability (`TargetFilter::ExiledBySource`) can later play it and
//!    `visibility.rs` grants the controller the CR 702.75a look-permission.
