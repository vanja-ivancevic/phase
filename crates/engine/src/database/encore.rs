//! Encore (CR 702.141) — graveyard-activated, per-opponent token-copy keyword.
//!
//! CR 702.141a: "Encore [cost]" is an activated ability that functions only
//! while the card with encore is in a graveyard:
//!
//! > "[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: For each opponent, create a
//! > token that's a copy of this card that attacks that opponent this turn if
//! > able. The tokens gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next
//! > end step. Activate only as a sorcery."
//!
//! Like Embalm / Eternalize (`database/embalm_eternalize.rs`) and Unearth
//! (`database/unearth.rs`), Encore is an activated ability that functions only
//! while the card is in a graveyard, so the synthesized ability carries
//! `activation_zone = Some(Zone::Graveyard)` and `sorcery_speed()`, and exiles
//! the card from the graveyard as part of its activation cost (CR 602.1a).
//!
//! The per-opponent copy generation, the "attacks that opponent this turn"
//! requirement, the haste grant, and the next-end-step sacrifice are not
//! expressible as a composition of existing leaf effects (the generic
//! `Effect::ForceAttack` cannot resolve "the opponent" from a context ref), so
//! the body lives in a single dedicated `Effect::Encore` resolver
//! (`game/effects/encore.rs`), mirroring its sibling `Effect::Myriad`. This
//! module only builds the activation shell around it.
