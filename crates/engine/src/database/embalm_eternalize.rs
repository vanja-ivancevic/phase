//! Embalm (CR 702.128) and Eternalize (CR 702.129) — graveyard-activated
//! token-copy keywords.
//!
//! Both keywords are activated abilities that function only while the card is in
//! a graveyard (CR 702.128a / CR 702.129a). Each means:
//!
//! > "[cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy
//! > of this card, except <overrides>. Activate only as a sorcery."
//!
//! The two keywords differ only in the per-token *override set* applied on top
//! of the copy, so this module factors the shared shape into a single builder
//! (`token_copy_ability`) parameterized by the keyword's activation cost (mana
//! or a composite mana + non-mana cost, e.g. the Champion of Wits "{3}{U}{U},
//! Discard a card") and its `ContinuousModification` overrides — the "build for
//! the class" pattern. The
//! overrides reuse the existing copy-exception building block
//! (`Effect::CopyTokenOf.additional_modifications`), which the token-copy
//! resolver bakes into the synthesized token at creation
//! (see `game/effects/token_copy.rs`).
//!
//! Self-exile mechanics: the card is exiled as a cost via
//! `AbilityCost::Exile { filter: SelfRef, .. }` — CR 602.1a (the activation cost
//! is everything before the colon) — which the engine auto-pays without a player
//! choice. The card keeps its `ObjectId` when it moves graveyard → exile
//! (`game/zones.rs::move_to_zone` mutates the zone in place), so
//! `Effect::CopyTokenOf { target: SelfRef }` still resolves to the exiled card
//! and `compute_current_copiable_values` reads its printed copiable values from
//! the exile zone.
//!
//! Scope note — CR 702.128b ("a token is *embalmed* if it's created by a
//! resolving embalm ability"): this token-status flag is not tracked here
//! because no implemented card's *runtime* depends on it. The only card that
//! references it is Vizier of Many Faces ("…except if ~ was embalmed…"), whose
//! self-referential clone ETB is a separate, already-incomplete parser concern
//! (its "if embalmed" condition is not currently captured), so tracking the flag
//! would be dead infrastructure for a single card — see "build for the class".
