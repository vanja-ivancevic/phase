//! Compile-time stack-budget ceilings for the types that dominate a
//! `GameState` stack frame.
//!
//! Not a rules invariant — a stack-budget one. `phase-server` moves `GameState`
//! by value through the action + AI path (`pre_action_state` in
//! `server-core/session.rs` and `boundary_snapshot` in `game/engine.rs` are
//! live simultaneously), so inline size is multiplied by every live slot. A
//! silent size regression there is an uncatchable guard-page abort in release,
//! not a catchable panic: `[profile.server-release]` is `panic = "unwind"`, and
//! unwinding cannot contain a stack overflow.
//!
//! `GameState`'s large maps are `im::HashMap` with structural sharing, so
//! `state.clone()` is already cheap on the *heap*. Nothing makes the inline
//! value cheap on a *stack frame* — that is what these ceilings bound.
//!
//! Ceilings are `measured.next_multiple_of(256) + 256` — one full 256 B bucket
//! of deliberate slack above the rounded measurement.
//!
//! The extra bucket is not laziness, it is calibration to the regression class.
//! What these asserts exist to catch is an inline `ResolvedAbility` (**5,264
//! B**) or a similar whole-struct field creeping back into a hot type; 256 B of
//! slack cannot hide anything in that class. What a zero-slack ceiling *does*
//! catch is an ordinary `Option<ObjectId>` on `PendingTrigger` — a struct that
//! is extended routinely — which would have tripped a build for an unrelated
//! author with no context for this file. Sized this way, the assert stays a
//! tripwire for layout regressions and stops being a tollbooth on normal work.
//!
//! Reproduce the measurement with an isolated target dir so a running Tilt keeps
//! the workspace cargo lock:
//!
//! ```text
//! CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/gs-size RUSTFLAGS="-Zprint-type-sizes" \
//!   cargo build -p phase-engine --lib \
//!   | grep 'print-type-size type: `types::game_state::GameState`:'
//! ```
//!
//! Measured on `nightly-2026-04-19` — `GameState` on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,
//! the other three rows on aarch64-apple-darwin (not re-measured):
//!
//! | Type | before boxing | after | ceiling |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|
//! | `GameState` | 30,112 | 13,872 | 14,336 |
//! | `StackEntry` | 5,336 | 344 | 768 |
//! | `PendingCast` | 6,632 | 1,376 | 1,792 |
//! | `PendingTrigger` | 6,000 | 744 | 1,024 |
//!
//! When one of these fires, re-run the measurement above and change the number
//! deliberately — do not widen a ceiling to make a build pass.
//!
//! 64-bit only: `wasm32` has a different layout and its own (smaller) budget.
