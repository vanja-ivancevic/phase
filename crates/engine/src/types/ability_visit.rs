//! The engine's single complete `AbilityDefinition` / `Effect` traversal.
//!
//! This code was moved verbatim out of `game/printed_cards.rs`, where it was
//! specialized to conjure-name collection, and parameterized by a visitor
//! closure so any "can this ability tree contain effect shape X" question can
//! reuse it. The name-extraction leaf stayed behind in `printed_cards.rs`.
//!
//! The `match`es over `Effect`, `ContinuousModification`, and `AbilityCost` are
//! wildcard-free **on purpose**: a new variant on any of those three enums is a
//! compile error here, which forces a descend-or-leaf decision at the one place
//! that owns the answer.
//!
//! That guarantee is necessary but not sufficient. A new nested **struct field**
//! is field access, not a match arm, so it compiles silently. Three fixtures are
//! the complementary safety nets:
//!
//! - `game::printed_cards::tests::walker_covers_every_nested_carrier`
//! - `ai_support::targeted_exchange::tests::predicate_sees_a_fight_in_every_nested_carrier`
//! - `parser::oracle::tests::render_net_reaches_every_nested_description_carrier`
//!
//! Each plants a marker in every carrier its walker descends into.
//! Extend **all three** whenever a carrier is added.
//!
//! The third belongs to a **`description`-shaped** walker
//! (`parser::oracle::render_effect_descriptions`, the CR 201.5a display-render
//! net), not an `Effect`-shaped one, and at the `Effect`-ARM level its descend
//! set is a strict SUPERSET of this module's: it also descends `Effect::Mana`,
//! `GrantCastingPermission`, `ExileResolvingSpellInsteadOfGraveyard`,
//! `CreateDelayedTrigger.condition`, the copy family,
//! `AddPendingEntersModifications`, `EachPlayerCopyChosen`, and `ReturnAsAura`,
//! all leaves here. So a carrier added there is not necessarily a carrier here,
//! but a carrier added here is always one there. The superset relation does NOT
//! extend one level down: this module descends
//! `ContinuousModification::CopyValues` into `visit_copiable_values_scoped` and
//! that net deliberately does not (`CopyValues` is parse-unreachable).
//!
//! Two narrower ad-hoc walkers remain unmigrated and are candidate future
//! consumers: `game::coverage::ability_tree_any` (which has a `_ => {}`
//! wildcard and omits many carriers — broadening it would change the coverage
//! report) and `game::replacement::ability_tree_creates_tokens` (which walks
//! only `Token` / `ChooseOneOf` / `sub_ability` / `else_ability` — broadening it
//! would change replacement behavior). Neither is migrated here, because either
//! migration would change behavior.
//!
//! # [`ResolutionScope`] — the own-resolution boundary
//!
//! Some callers need to know only what an ability does during **its own**
//! resolution, not what it merely *registers* to happen later. [`ResolutionScope`]
//! names that axis: CR 608.2c ("the controller of the spell or ability follows
//! its instructions in the order written") versus CR 603.3 (a triggered ability
//! is put on the stack "the next time a player would receive priority" — a
//! separate object, resolving separately). `is_mana_ability`'s CR 605.1a
//! library criterion is the first consumer.
//!
//! Under [`ResolutionScope::OwnResolutionOnly`] the walk visits the boundary
//! node itself but does **not** descend into payloads that belong to a later or
//! separate resolution: delayed triggers (CR 603.7a), registered replacements
//! (CR 614.1), emblem abilities (CR 114.1), token abilities (CR 111.1), granted
//! statics (CR 611.2), mana-spend grants (CR 603.3), and reflexive "when you do"
//! links (CR 603.12). Every existing public entry point passes
//! [`ResolutionScope::IncludeRegisteredLater`], so their behavior is unchanged.
//!
//! **The boundary has exactly two axes and one authority.** The effect walk
//! ([`visit_ability_def_scoped`]) and the cost walk
//! ([`visit_ability_def_costs_scoped`]) are separate because the effect
//! visitor is `FnMut(&Effect)` and an `AbilityCost::Mill` is not an `Effect` —
//! a type-level gap, not a missing match arm. Both consult
//! `scope_prunes_nested_ability` for the CR 603.12 decision and neither
//! re-implements it.
//!
//! **Scope-reset invariant.** `visit_trigger_scoped`, `visit_replacement_scoped`,
//! `visit_static_scoped`, `visit_continuous_mod_scoped`, and
//! `visit_copiable_values_scoped` are unreachable under `OwnResolutionOnly`
//! today, because every `visit_effect_scoped` arm that reaches them is a gated
//! boundary carrier. That is asserted by a `debug_assert!` at the head of each,
//! but correctness does **not** depend on the assertion: `scope` is propagated
//! into every nested `visit_ability_def_scoped` call, so the invariant holds by
//! construction in release builds too. The assertion is a decision-forcing
//! tripwire, not the mechanism.
