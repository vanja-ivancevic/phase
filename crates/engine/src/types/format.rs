///     `GameFormat::deserialize(d).map(SelectedFormat::Tag)`. Both impls are
///     hand-written, never derived, so serde never emits or accepts an
///     externally-tagged `{"Tag":…}` / `{"Resolved":…}` envelope.
///
/// (2) The complete, exhaustive list of places `SelectedFormat::Resolved` is
///     CONSTRUCTED is exactly one: `validate_name_deck_for_format_full` in
///     `game::deck_validation`, trusted Rust that already holds a
///     `&FormatConfig` supplied by its caller. After any change touching
///     this type, run `grep -rn "SelectedFormat::Resolved" --include=*.rs
///     crates/` and manually triage every hit into one of three buckets: the
///     single production construction site above; a `match`/pattern-match
///     arm that only READS an already-existing value (e.g. `tag()`'s and
///     `rules()`'s own arms in this file, and this doc comment's own prose)
///     — expected and unlimited in count, never a violation; or a
///     `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block. A naive `grep -v
///     "tests/\|#\[cfg(test)\]"` text filter looks appealing but does NOT
///     work here: `deck_validation.rs` and this very file each have their
///     own `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block thousands of lines above their
///     in-module test construction sites, and a line-based `grep -v` cannot
///     see "this line lives inside that module" — it can only filter lines
///     that literally contain the attribute text. Do not trust a bare
///     non-test-directory line count from this command; read each hit.

/// (3) The gate `built_in_axes_no_looser_than_rules` runs at every
///     `FormatConfig` construction site with no exceptions, because every

    ///   `FormatConfig::default_for_player_count`'s output when the caller
    ///   declared no config at all.

    ///   is also a retryable wire rejection, but unlike the two ingress
    ///   guards above it does NOT skip this check when the config is
    ///   undeclared: `initialize_game_impl` is the one call site that
