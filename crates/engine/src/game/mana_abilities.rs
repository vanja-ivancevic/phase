/// * A whole-tree choice-free cost that sacrifices exactly the ability's own
///   source ([`mana_sources::has_unambiguous_self_sacrifice_component`]) —
///   Treasure's `{T}, Sacrifice this token` (CR 111.10a) and Gold's tapless
///   `Sacrifice this token` (CR 111.10c). `SacrificeRequirement::Aggregate`,
///   `Count { count: n > 1 }` and every non-`SelfRef` target are excluded BY
///   CONSTRUCTION by that predicate's `Count { count: 1 }` / `SelfRef` match —
///   a non-self sacrifice may have no legal victim, so its simulation is
///   load-bearing and must not be skipped.
///
/// The second shape is the first MULTI-component cost the engine answers
/// without simulating, so the two divergences an earlier component can
/// introduce are guarded explicitly. Both guards are conservative: a `true`
/// declines the fast path and falls through to the unchanged simulation, so a
/// spurious guard costs performance, never correctness. Note that Guard 2's
/// granularity is the whole board rather than this source: `static_kind_present`
/// is a board-global `StaticModeKind` presence read (CR 604.1), so a single
/// `CantPayCost` permanent anywhere on the battlefield (Yasharn, Impeccable Sire)
/// returns EVERY mana source to the clone path, not only the sources a
/// prohibition could actually name.
///
/// Two divergences deliberately need NO guard:
/// * CR 616.1 — a replacement on the sacrifice's battlefield -> graveyard move
///   makes `sacrifice_permanent` return `NeedsReplacementChoice`, which the
///   self-sacrifice payment arm maps to `Ok(ManaAbilityPaymentProgress::Paused)`,
///   so the simulation returns `Ok` and reports the same `true` this path does.
/// * CR 608.2h — the production tail runs after the source has left the

///   `CountersOn { scope: Source }`) reads last known information. That changes
///   the amount of mana, never the legality answer: the tail's only two `?`
///   operators are `mana_ability_definition` (rescued by the activation's

    // already-paid cost observer — Scavenger's Talent, Korvold, Mayhem Devil,
    // ...; #5963); and a `Priority` resume with an empty ledger fell through to
    // the pipeline's own generic scan. The first bypass could dispatch an
    // ordinary cost observer separately from this frame's synthetic reflexive;

    // resume, and nothing double-fires (e.g. Kilo's becomes-tapped proliferate
    // under a standalone Relic activation).

    // root: this frame's accepted triggered mana must be spendable BY the thing
    // it resumes into (the automatic payment finalizer, the unless-payment
