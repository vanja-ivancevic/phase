//! Deterministic action-based replay reconstruction.
//!
//! A recorded game (`ReplayLog`) carries no per-turn state — only the inputs
//! needed to reconstruct its starting state (`ReplayHeader`) and the ordered
//! sequence of actions that were submitted and accepted. Because `apply` is a
//! pure reducer over a `GameState` seeded from a fixed RNG seed, replaying the
//! same actions against the same starting state reproduces the original game
//! exactly. `ReplayPlayer` wraps that reconstruction with sparse checkpoint
//! caching so scrubbing to an arbitrary point doesn't re-simulate the whole
//! game from turn 1 every time.
