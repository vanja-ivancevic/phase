//! Single authority for iterating "ability definitions that function right now."
//!
//! Statics, triggers, and replacements each live on `GameObject`s, but they
//! are gated by different CR rules. Every read site that previously
//! iterated `obj.static_definitions` / `obj.trigger_definitions` /
//! `obj.replacement_definitions` directly has to apply these gates itself,
//! which has been a recurring source of bugs. This module centralizes the
//! gating so callers cannot silently drop:
//!
//! - **CR 702.26b** — phased-out permanents' abilities don't function.
//! - **CR 114.4** — objects in the command zone don't function unless they
//!   are emblems.
//! - **CR 604.1 / CR 613.1** — a static ability only applies while its
//!   `condition` evaluates true (continuous re-evaluation).
//!
//! # Zone scope asymmetry
//!
//! - **Statics**: the full CR 113.6 zone-of-function gate lives in the shared
//!   `static_functions_in_zone` predicate, which is a three-way split: a
//!   characteristic-defining ability (`characteristic_defining`) functions in
//!   all zones unconditionally per CR 604.3, independent of `active_zones`;
//!   otherwise a non-empty `active_zones` restricts a static to exactly the
//!   listed zones (an opt-in off-zone static, e.g. a cost reducer); otherwise
//!   empty `active_zones` defaults to battlefield-only. Command-zone objects
//!   use the emblem-or-opt-in gate for the latter two cases. Six
//!   gathers delegate to it — `active_static_definitions` (which also layers
//!   CR 113.6g's stack exception for self-referential
//!   `CantBeCountered`/`CantBeCopied` on top, plus the CR 604.1 / CR 613.1
//!   condition gate), `game_functioning_statics`, `battlefield_functioning_statics`,
//!   `layers::active_combat_assignment_rule_effects_from_static_definitions`,
//!   `combat::compute_combat_tax`, and (as of issue #8158)
//!   `layers::active_continuous_effects_from_static_definitions`'s
//!   `StaticZoneAdmission::LiveSource` path — the ordinary gather feeding
//!   `collect_shared_active_continuous_effects`. **Its OTHER admission,
//!   `StaticZoneAdmission::PreFilteredBaseStatic`, is the one remaining
//!   exception**: `active_continuous_effects_from_base_static_source` screens
//!   `base_static_definitions` through the caller-side
//!   `base_static_can_source_off_zone_keyword_query` pre-filter, which
//!   intentionally admits a self-referential (`affected: SelfRef`)
//!   definition with empty `active_zones` regardless of the object's current
//!   zone — that pre-filter exists precisely so `off_zone_characteristics.rs`
//!   can answer "what would this object's own characteristics be off the
//!   battlefield" (e.g. Dream Devourer). Re-running `static_functions_in_zone`
//!   on an already-admitted definition would reject exactly what that
//!   pre-filter meant to admit, so the `PreFilteredBaseStatic` path
//!   intentionally skips the shared gate. Callers of the six delegating call
//!   sites never need to pre-filter statics by zone; callers reaching
//!   `PreFilteredBaseStatic` should read `layers.rs`'s own comments for its
//!   exact rule.
//! - **Triggers**: gated to the battlefield by the caller's choice of
//!   iteration (`battlefield_active_*`). Command-zone emblems pass the
//!   phased-out/command-zone gate for per-object iteration, and non-emblem
//!   command-zone objects may contribute definitions that explicitly opt in
//!   via `trigger_zones`.
//! - **Replacements**: NOT battlefield-scoped. Zone-of-function is a
//!   per-replacement property on `ReplacementDefinition`, so
//!   `active_replacements` scans every object and only applies the
//!   phased-out / command-zone gate. The per-definition part of the gate is
//!   `replacement_functions_in_zone`, the replacement-side twin of
//!   `static_functions_in_zone`: a non-empty `active_zones` restricts the
//!   definition to exactly those zones per CR 113.6b (CR 702.52a dredge —
//!   graveyard only), and an empty one takes the `DEFAULT_REPLACEMENT_ZONES`
//!   default. `find_applicable_replacements` consults that predicate and layers
//!   the event-dependent CR 614.12 / CR 702.35a self-replacement carve-outs on
//!   top of the default case. CR 903.9a commander redirection is handled
//!   separately in `zones::move_to_zone` — it is not routed through
//!   `ReplacementDefinition`.
//!
//! # Condition filtering
//!
//! Only `active_static_definitions` filters by `condition`
//! (CR 604.1 / CR 613.1 — statics are evaluated continuously). Trigger
//! intervening-if (CR 603.4) is a two-point check at trigger placement and
//! resolution, and replacement-effect conditions (CR 616) are evaluated at
//! event time. Both of those checks stay at their existing pipeline
//! checkpoints, so these helpers deliberately do NOT filter triggers or
//! replacements by their own `condition` fields.
