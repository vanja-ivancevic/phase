//! CR 400.11 + CR 400.11b: sealed booster packs as a source of cards from
//! outside the game.
//!
//! Opening a booster pack has no Comprehensive Rules entry — it is a physical
//! action the printed cards instruct a player to perform ("Open a sealed Magic
//! booster pack", Booster Tutor / Summon the Pack / A Container of Booster
//! Packs), and the cards it produces are outside the game until the effect
//! brings some of them in (CR 400.11b). This module is the digital substitute
//! for the physical pack: it stocks a per-game **shelf** of booster products
//! from the loaded card database and collates a fresh pack from one of them on
//! demand.
//!
//! Cube-derived games instead hydrate their original source entries with
//! [`build_pool_shelf`]. [`open_pack`] samples fifteen entries from that source,
//! preserving its copies and ignoring set printings and rarity buckets.
//!
//! # Why a shelf and not the whole corpus
//!
//! There is no `CardDatabase` at effect-resolution time — resolvers see only
//! `&mut GameState` — so any card a pack can produce must already be hydrated
//! into game state as a `CardFace`. Hydrating every printing of every set would
//! clone the entire card database (tens of thousands of faces) into every game.
//! Instead [`build_shelf`] stocks a bounded, deterministic sample of sets
//! ([`SHELF_PRODUCTS`]) with a bounded sample of each set's cards
//! ([`MAX_BUCKET`]). Packs are collated per resolution, so the number of packs a
//! game can open stays unbounded while the resident cost is proportional to the
//! shelf.
//!
//! # Rarity fidelity
//!
//! `CardFace::rarities` records every rarity a card has been printed at across
//! ALL sets, not its rarity in one particular set — the card-data export carries
//! no per-printing rarity. A card therefore stocks every bucket it has ever been
//! printed into, so a common that was later reprinted at rare can also appear in
//! a rare slot. Pack collation is otherwise the modern draft-booster skeleton
//! (ten commons, three uncommons, one rare-or-mythic), and a pack never repeats
//! a card. Recording per-printing rarity in the export would remove the
//! approximation without changing anything here but the bucketing rule.
