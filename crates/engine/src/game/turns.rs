    // `run_post_action_pipeline_from`), i.e. AFTER the
    // abilities are stacked rather than before. Whether cleanup
    // should perform a full CR 704 pass at CR 514.3a's exact instant is a
    // separate question, deliberately not answered here.
    //
    // REACHABILITY — read this block as defence in depth, NOT as documentation
    // of a live path. No production route through the public API was FOUND that
    // reaches it with a non-empty queue. The two structural reasons, which need
    // no census: the drain at the end of `process_phase_triggers` sits in that
    // function's shared body rather than in any one arm, so it runs for whatever
    // phase/step arm reaches it; and the pipeline's drain likewise sits in
    // `engine_priority::run_post_action_pipeline_from`'s body, so it runs for
    // settlements routed through it. The one cleanup path that pauses and
    // resumes — discard to maximum hand size — never re-enters this function
    // (its resume runs `finish_cleanup_discard` and then the pipeline), so its
    // CR 514.3a settlement comes from the pipeline, not from here.
    //
    // The remaining input, "who parks a batch during cleanup", rests on an
    // identifier search for `collect_triggers_into_deferred` that returns no hit
    // in this file. That instrument cannot see a macro-generated or
    // trait-dispatched call, so treat it as "none found", not "none exists" —
    // which is the second reason the block stays.
    //
    // It is kept regardless: CR 514.3a is a real obligation at this exact
    // instant, the block is inert when the queue is empty (the gate refuses, it
    // returns `None`, and cleanup advances unchanged), and it is the local
    // guarantee that a future producer which parks a batch during cleanup
    // cannot carry it across the Cleanup -> Untap wrap. If you are looking for
    // the code that settles a parked batch in practice, it is the step-boundary
    // drain in `process_phase_triggers` or the post-action pipeline.
    //
    // A parked `deferred_triggers` batch IS "a triggered ability waiting to be
    // put onto the stack", so it must settle HERE, during cleanup — not survive
    // `advance_phase_once`'s Cleanup -> Untap wrap (which runs `start_next_turn`)
    // and land on the next turn's upkeep. CR 514.3 (the parent rule) says no
    // player normally receives priority during cleanup and then states that this
    // is the exception; returning `Some(Priority { .. })` is that exception, not
    // a violation of it.
    //
    // POPULATION — this checks `deferred_triggers` only, unlike the CR 603.3b +
    // issue #1350 guard in `auto_advance_once`'s `Phase::CombatDamage` arm
    // (grep `issue #1350` in this file), which checks
    // `!deferred_triggers.is_empty() || pending_trigger.is_some()`. The
    // `pending_trigger` disjunct is deliberately excluded, not overlooked: a live
    // `pending_trigger` means a trigger is mid-construction and owns the open
    // prompt, so `current_trigger_prompt` still echoes for it (that disjunct is
    // retained by the CR 603.3d narrowing) and the game would be sitting at that
    // trigger's own target/mode choice rather than passing priority into cleanup.
    // If that assumption is ever falsified, the fix is to widen this condition to
    // match that `Phase::CombatDamage` guard, not to add a second block.
    //
    // The second half of CR 514.3a — "another cleanup step begins" — is ALREADY
    // implemented: `priority.rs:79-90` re-enters `auto_advance` when all players
    // pass with an empty stack at `Phase::Cleanup`, which re-runs this function.
    // On that repeat the queue is empty, `can_drain_deferred_triggers` refuses,
    // the stack does not grow, and cleanup advances normally.
    //
    // TERMINATION, in two parts. (1) No in-process loop is possible: this block
    // returns only `Some(..)` — which the `Phase::Cleanup` arm converts to
    // `AutoAdvanceStep::Waiting`, exiting `auto_advance`'s UNBOUNDED loop (no
    // iteration cap) — or `None`, which advances the phase. It can never yield
    // `Continue`, so it cannot spin that loop. Part (1) is what carries
    // termination; it is sufficient on its own. (2) An unbounded REPEAT would
    // still not be a freeze: each repeat cleanup step costs a real
    // `PassPriority` from every living seat before `priority.rs:79-90` re-enters,
    // so the game remains answerable throughout and any seat may act instead of
    // passing. No CR draw rule is claimed for that case — CR 104.4b's draw is
    // for loops of MANDATORY actions and expressly excludes loops containing an
    // optional action, so it is not the authority here.
    // NOTE: this is NOT the argument `priority.rs:86-89` makes for the
    // control-reversion case — that one is monotone-decreasing (its one-shot TCE
    // is already pruned, so no new event re-fires). Nothing analogous holds for
    // `deferred_triggers`, which can in principle be re-parked by a resolving
    // ability; the two parts above are why termination holds anyway.
    //
    // Structurally identical to the CR 514.3a control-reversion block above
    // (`check_delayed_triggers` + stack-growth pause); same authority, same
    // shape, different waiting population.
    //
    // `drain_deferred_trigger_queue` (the restrictive member, gate
    // `can_drain_deferred_triggers(state, /*allow_spell_on_stack=*/false)`) is
    // the right authority: cleanup is reached only after the end step's stack
    // emptied (CR 500.2), so the guard passes on every normal entry, and a
    // refusal is inert — the stack does not grow, this returns `None`, and
    // cleanup advances exactly as it does today.

    // `drain_deferred_trigger_queue` (not the post-announcement variant) is

    // spell_on_stack=*/false)`. CR 500.2 means a step in which players receive
    // priority ends only with an empty stack, so on every normal step entry the
    // guard passes; when it does not, refusing is the CR 601.2h + CR 602.2b
    // conservative choice (issue #1793) and CANNOT re-wedge the game — a `None`
    // prompt makes every calling arm fall through to `WaitingFor::Priority`,
    // which is answerable and re-drains through the post-action pipeline.
    // (Note: the entry gate is restrictive, but `dispatch_deferred_triggers_in_order`
    // in `triggers.rs` ends in a tail call to
    // `drain_deferred_triggers_after_trigger_construction`, whose `else` arm is
    // permissive — identical to the deferred-drain branch of
    // `engine_priority::run_post_action_pipeline_from`, and behaviourally the
    // same here because the stack is empty at a step boundary.)

    // NOTE: unlike the post-action pipeline's deferred-drain branch, this drain
    // is not gated on `skip_deferred_trigger_drain` — and does not need to be.
    //
    // Do NOT defend that with a census of the flag's call sites. The opt-out can
    // be passed positionally (as it is by the trailing `true` in
    // `engine_resolution_choices::park_cast_during_resolution_cast_observers`),
    // and a positional literal carries no identifier, so no search for the
    // flag's name can enumerate the sites that set it.
    //
    // The gate is the protection instead. The flag exists to hold a drain back
    // while a parent resolution continuation is still open (CR 608.2e, issue
    // #1793). That condition is a property of state, and this drain already
    // tests it directly: `drain_deferred_trigger_queue` is gated by
    // `can_drain_deferred_triggers`, which refuses unless
    // `triggers::resolution_completion_can_settle` — the same predicate that
    // guards the pipeline's sibling branch, and the one that returns `false`
    // while `resolving_stack_entry` is live under a resolution-choice prompt.
