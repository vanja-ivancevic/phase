//! Discriminating tests for the `(EndCombat, DeclareAttackers)` wedge and the
//! un-drained `deferred_triggers` queue behind it.
//!
//! REACHABILITY NOTE (non-negotiable — read before editing any fixture here).
//! Every test in this module seeds its parked batch by calling the engine's own
//! collector, `triggers::collect_triggers_into_deferred(state, &[real
//! ZoneChanged event])`. Nothing here hand-constructs a `PendingTriggerContext`
//! and nothing here hand-assembles a corrupt `GameState`: the trigger contexts
//! are built by the real collector, from a real event whose `ZoneChangeRecord`
//! comes from the authoritative production constructor
//! (`GameObject::snapshot_for_zone_change`), against a real `GameObject` created
//! by `zones::create_object`. **Everything downstream of seeding is the
//! unmodified production pipeline** — `apply()` / `start_game_skip_mulligan()`
//! → reducer → `handle_declare_attackers` / `handle_priority_pass` →
//! `finish_declare_attackers` / `advance_phase_once` → `auto_advance` →
//! `execute_cleanup` → `sync_waiting_for`.
//!
//! Why a fully-public seeding path is not used: `run_post_action_pipeline`
//! drains at every `WaitingFor::Priority` boundary, so **on a fixed engine no
//! public action sequence can leave a queue parked across a boundary — the
//! reachable park IS the bug.** `collect_triggers_into_deferred` is
//! `pub(crate)`, which is why these live in an in-crate module rather than in
//! `tests/integration/`. The public-API positive controls that prove these
//! assertions are non-vacuous live in
//! `tests/integration/declare_attackers_end_combat_pairing.rs`.
