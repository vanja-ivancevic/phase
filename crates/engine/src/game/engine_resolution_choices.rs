///
/// CR 732.1a: "The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the
/// game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable."
/// This engine IS the table's shortcut system, and CR 732.1b states the job that system performs:
/// the shortcut rules determine "how many times those actions are repeated without having to
/// actually perform them, and HOW THE LOOP IS BROKEN". Defining and enforcing where an elided
/// infinite loop closes is that second clause, not a departure from it.
///
/// THE INVARIANT THIS GATE PROTECTS (full statement, with lemmas, at `types::game_state`'s
/// `scheduled_collapse_axes` doc): ELISION ≡ PERFORMANCE — the engine never advances to a state
/// that performing the proposal's choices would not produce, which is exactly what CR 732.2c means
/// by reaching the ending point "with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal having
/// been taken". Once an observer appears mid-window, a batched advance would reach a state those
/// choices would NOT produce, and replaying an observer-laden sequence would execute a proposal
/// nobody accepted. Declining to manual play is the only CR 732-faithful option left, so THIS GATE
/// ENFORCES CR 732.2c — the deviation would be either alternative it forecloses.
///
/// So this re-check is not the engine second-guessing an accepted proposal. It is the system
/// establishing, at the point where the elided loop closes, what the table agreed would happen.
/// When the growth is no longer observed the elision no longer describes the board, the shortcut
/// does not close there, and the axis stays `∞` for manual play — every player keeps priority and
/// every choice they would have had. Nobody loses an entitlement they accepted; what they lose is
/// a shortcut that had stopped matching the game.
///
/// Earlier revisions of this doc called the re-check unlicensed. That conceded a rule the code
/// satisfies. The subsystem's single authority for the full four-position reading is
/// `types/game_state.rs`'s `scheduled_collapse_axes` doc; see also `game/derived_views.rs`'s
/// `THE WINDOW'S TIMING IS CR 732.2c'S ADVANCE` block. `derived_views::FamilyCollapseState` still
/// separates `Committed` from the weaker variants, because being right about WHEN the loop closes
/// is not the same as knowing WHAT NUMBER lands, and `∞→N` is a promise about the number.
///
/// CR 732.2a supplies the CONTENT of the re-check, and its antecedent is worth stating exactly so
/// nobody over-reads it: "at any point in the game, THE PLAYER WITH PRIORITY MAY SUGGEST a shortcut
/// … that may be legally taken based on the current game state and THE PREDICTABLE RESULTS of the
/// sequence of choices" — subject = the proposing player, moment = suggestion. It is a legality
/// condition on a PROPOSAL, so it is not self-executing at the boundary; what re-applies it there is
/// the shortcut system's CR 732.1a mandate to close the loop the way the table understood it. The

/// STEP (0) IS NOT ONE OF FOUR — IT RUNS FIRST AND CAN END THE SEARCH. Before citing any rule for

/// SINGLE AUTHORITY for how this subsystem stands under CR 732, and if your question is answered
/// there, cite it rather than re-deriving a reading beside it.
///
/// A WARNING WITH A WORKED EXAMPLE, because this step used to say the opposite. It previously told
/// you that finding an existing "no CR licenses" admission ENDED the search — that looking for a
/// rule was itself the category error. That instruction was wrong, and it was self-sealing: the
/// admissions were written before the reading existed, and the gate then prevented anyone from
/// checking whether they were true. Five citations were tried and rejected on this branch before
/// the reading was found, which is what made the admissions look load-bearing. **An admission in
/// the code is evidence about what a previous author concluded, never evidence about what the
/// rules say.** Re-verify it against the text like any other claim.
///
/// THE CONSTRUCTIVE FORM OF STEP (0): A LICENSE CLAIM MUST NAME ITS INVARIANT. Do not assert that a
/// rule licenses a site; state the property the site preserves and show the rule is about that
/// property. Here the invariant is ELISION ≡ PERFORMANCE (`types::game_state`'s
/// `scheduled_collapse_axes` doc), and CR 732.1a is what covers differences in the SYSTEM'S FORM so
/// long as that invariant holds. A claim with no named invariant is the same error as an admission
/// with no verification — both skip the step where someone could check.
///
/// The remaining steps always
/// apply: (1) EXISTENCE — grep the rule number in `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`;
/// (2) CONTENT, ON BOTH ANTECEDENT AXES — *subject* (who or what the antecedent is about; does it
/// describe this code's actual matched text or predicate?) and *time* (an antecedent fixes a moment;
/// a permission granted at proposal time does not travel past acceptance, and a legality condition
/// on a proposal does not become a continuing-validity condition); (3) NORMATIVE DIRECTION — is this
/// rule the one the code *applies*, or the one the code *deviates from*? Citing the deviated-from
/// rule as a license inverts the annotation's meaning.
///
/// "NO CR GOVERNS THIS" IS STILL A SAFE, CORRECT, FINAL VERDICT WHERE IT IS TRUE — reaching for the
/// next closest-sounding rule remains the error. In-tree precedent that survives: `game/filter.rs`'s
/// `context_free_prop_matches_face` Kleene `AnyOf` arm, which answers an `Option<bool>` question
/// that is not a rules behavior at all.
///
/// THE TWO FAILURE MODES ARE SYMMETRIC, AND THIS SUBSYSTEM HAS NOW COMMITTED BOTH. Citing a
/// closest-sounding rule as a license inverts an annotation's meaning; conceding a deviation the
/// code does not actually commit gives away a rule the implementation satisfies, and it is the
/// harder error to detect because it reads as rigor. Prefer the reading you can defend clause by
/// clause, and where a clause genuinely does not reach the code, say so — but only after checking.
///
/// DO NOT COPY A CITATION SET FROM ONE SITE TO ANOTHER. The parser
/// (`parse_optional_token_substitution_choice` in `oracle_replacement.rs`)
/// answers "what does this card's text create?"; this boundary answers "why does this mint pause?"
/// Same card, different questions, different rules.
///
/// CR 614.1 / CR 614.1a TRAVEL TO THE BOUNDARY WHERE CR 608.2d CANNOT, because 614.1 is
/// EVENT-SCOPED IN THE PERMISSIVE DIRECTION — "replacement effects apply continuously as events

/// — "if an effect OF A SPELL OR ABILITY offers any choices" — and at a source-less mint its

/// The rule has now failed twice, each time through its own carve-out. The first form exempted
/// files the edit itself re-derives; this change then moved `derived_views.rs`'s CR 732 doctrine block
/// ~120 lines and shipped five citations pointing at unrelated code, which read as "the no-CR
