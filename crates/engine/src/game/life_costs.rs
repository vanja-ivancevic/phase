//! Single authority for paying life as a cost.
//!
//! All cost paths that deduct life — spell additional costs (Flashback life,
//! generic "Pay N life" additional costs), activated-ability costs (Greed,
//! Necropotence, Phyrexian Tower family), mana-ability costs, `Effect::PayCost`
//! resolution, and `UnlessCost::PayLife` — route through [`pay_life_as_cost`].
//!
//! Pre-validation sites (`can_activate_ability_now`, Defiler offer, legal-action
//! generation) consult [`can_pay_life_cost`] so the UI never offers a cost the
//! player cannot actually pay.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! - **CR 118.3** — A player can't pay a cost without the resources to pay it fully.
//! - **CR 118.3b** — Paying life subtracts the amount from the player's life total.
//!   Players can always pay 0 life.
//! - **CR 119.4** — "If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from their
//!   life total; in other words, the player loses that much life." Paying life IS
//!   losing life, so the deduction routes through
//!   [`effects::life::apply_life_loss`] which runs the replacement pipeline.
//! - **CR 119.4b** — Players can always pay 0 life, even under a pay-life prohibition.
//! - **CR 119.8** — "A cost that involves having that player pay life can't be paid."
