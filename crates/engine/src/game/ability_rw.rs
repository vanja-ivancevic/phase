//! CR 603.3b: the PR-6.75 read/write **conflict** profiler — a second
//! compiler-exhaustive, wildcard-free walk of a resolved ability's typed AST,
//! sibling to `ability_scan.rs`. Where `ability_scan` answers three 1-bit
//! read-axis questions, this module answers the richer question the legacy
//! trigger-ordering paths need (§1.2 of the PR-6.75 plan, PR-6.25 §3 C0(ii)):
//! *which kinds of game state does an ability READ, which does it WRITE, and at
//! what scope* — so `group_is_order_independent` can auto-order a same-event or
//! co-departure group of normalized-identical siblings only when their
//! resolution functions provably commute (CR 603.3b), and prompt otherwise.
//!
//! The gate predicate is fail-closed and **kind/scope-aware**: two identical
//! siblings conflict iff one member's WRITE lands in a location class the other
//! member's LIVE read observes (a read/write *feed*). Members are normalized-
//! identical, so a sibling's write-set equals my own.
//!
//! # Soundness scope (documented residual)
//!
//! Commutation is proven **modulo the source-actor residual** (§1.2 side
//! condition): per-source granted state (lifelink CR 702.15 / deathtouch
//! CR 702.2), the `DamagedPlayerIsEventSourceOwner` referent (a damage-cause
//! source-owner read, `types/ability.rs`), and the CR 800.4a player-loss
//! object-removal cascade modulate resolution without appearing in the normalized
//! AST or any profiled read. Both channels were auto-ordered UNCONDITIONALLY by
//! the pre-C1 short-circuit and are inherited unchanged (zero ordering-decision
//! change). Damage kinds are therefore RECIPIENT-classified, not source-bound
//! (CR 704.5a / CR 800.4a). PR-6.75 c5 note: the batch-T1 path now clears at
//! `Uniform` (controller-equal) as well as `UniformAligned` (owner-equal), so —
//! unlike the owner-aligned span gate — it no longer equalizes source OWNER across
//! members. The `DamagedPlayerIsEventSourceOwner` / lifelink / deathtouch residual
//! exposure on the batch path is thus identical to the same-event T1 path already
//! documented, and bounded by the §7.1 `old=false, new=true` zero-movement grep.
//!
//! ## The event-object read/write feed (R4 review) — CLOSED at both depths
//!
//! A same-event group that WRITES the shared triggering object and then READS its
//! LIVE characteristic ("put a +1/+1 counter on it, then transform ~ if that
//! creature's power ≥ 6" ×2) is order-observable (CR 608.2h: the read uses the event
//! object's CURRENT information). `reads_event_live` records no KindSet, so the
//! `feeds()` matrix is structurally blind to it — the feed is instead gated by
//! `reads_and_writes_event_object` (`reads_event_live && writes_event_object.any()`):
//! the same-event discriminator (`s.same_event && s.event_object_present &&
//! reads_and_writes_event_object`) PROMPTS it, and the T1 fast-path disjunct excludes
//! it. The BATCH depth is protected differently: a co-departure event object is a
//! DEPARTED, FROZEN LKI (CR 603.10a) — a write no-ops (stable read ⇒ auto correct) or
//! is a reentry hazard ⇒ the freeze-invalidation row prompts. The `event_object_present`
//! conjunct mirrors `effective_external` (a write to a non-present event object no-ops,
//! targeting.rs:951), so a Phase-mode trigger stays auto (no live object ⇒ no feed).
//!
//! ## Residuals that REMAIN — both SYMMETRIC across batch and same-event depths
//!
//! 1. The **source-actor residual** (above): per-source granted state and the
//!    CR 800.4a player-loss cascade, invisible to the normalized AST.
//! 2. A **board-wide external write × event-live read**: a `writes_external` write NOT
//!    scoped to the event object (e.g. "each creature") that happens to mutate the
//!    event object, feeding an event-live read. `reads_and_writes_event_object` keys on
//!    `writes_event_object` (event-object-SCOPED writes) only, and `feeds()` stays blind
//!    (the live read carries no KindSet) — so this is uncaught. It is SYMMETRIC: the
//!    batch T1 conjunct also keys on `writes_event_object` (not `writes_external`), so
//!    the batch depth is equally open. Closing it needs either KindSet-recording
//!    event-live reads (so `feeds()` catches board writes) or promoting any
//!    `writes_external` to an event-object write under `reads_event_live` (a large
//!    over-prompt) — out of scope; documented-open.
//!
//! Both residuals are profile-INVISIBLE (the dependency is absent from the profiled
//! read/write sets) and equal-strength across depths. The gate is therefore sound
//! MODULO these two symmetric residuals — the exact scope the `group_is_order_
//! independent` contract (triggers.rs) records.
//!
//! # M3 binding mandate (review-blocking)
//!
//! Every NON-fully-conservative arm binds ALL payload fields of its variant;
//! `{ .. }` field elision is permitted ONLY on arms whose RHS is
//! maximal-conservative (`RwProfile::conservative()`). A precise arm that elides
//! a field would classify whatever that field carries as nothing — fail-OPEN
//! (the inc1 5-hole class). Same discipline as `ability_scan.rs`.
//!
//! # Traversal closure & fail-closed defaults
//!
//! Closed under payload reachability across the same type set as `ability_scan`
//! (`Effect`, `QuantityRef`, `QuantityExpr`, `AbilityCondition`,
//! `TriggerCondition`, `TargetFilter`, `ObjectScope`, `PlayerFilter`,
//! `PlayerScope`, `ControllerRef`, `CountScope`, `StaticCondition`, `Duration`),
//! plus the choice/RNG `AbilityDefinition` sub-bodies (§2 choice-wrapper / RNG
//! union descent). A future variant must fail to compile until classified. An
//! effect KIND absent from the plan's §1.3.1-D group-reachable histogram (zero
//! printed presence, nothing to flip) may take `RwProfile::conservative()`.
//! Sub-enums the walk does not descend (`FilterProp` interiors,
//! `PermissionGrantee`, `CombineSource`, `DamageSource`) are handled like
//! `ability_scan`'s conservative subtrees; the §5.2 parity sweep (commit 2) is
//! the arbiter for any D5 tag that hides only there.
//!
//! CR annotations: CR 603.3b (gate), CR 603.10a + CR 400.7 (frozen-read kinds +
//! freeze-invalidation row), CR 603.4 (condition inclusion), CR 603.5

//
// A `TargetFilter`/`ControllerRef`/`FilterProp` is MEMBER-BOUND when the object
// or player it resolves to is bound per member instance — per-source tracked or
// chosen storage, an attachment, or an event/replacement-context referent — so
// two normalized-identical members do NOT share one resolution function `f`.
// Position-agnostic and exhaustive (wildcard-free) so a future variant must be
// classified — mirrors `legacy_target_filter`'s descent structure exactly.
//
// Each FALSE arm's soundness rests on ONE of:
//   * source carrier — `SelfRef`/`SourceOrPaired` set `writes_self`/`reads_src`
//     ⇒ `source_independent()` already false.
//   * event-object carrier — `TriggeringSource` / parentless `ParentTarget` set
//     `writes_event_object` ⇒ T1's `!writes_event_object.any()` conjunct fires.
//   * legacy-12 carrier — the 9 frozen `TargetFilter` tags set
//     `legacy_batch_prompt` (OR-ed OUTSIDE `profiles_conflict`).
//   * resolution-local — `ScopedPlayer`/`LastRevealed`/`LastCreated`: bound
//     within the single resolution, no cross-member storage.
//   * member-invariant under uniformity — `Controller`/`Player`/`AllPlayers`/
//     `DefendingPlayer`/`Named`/`Specific*`: one shared `c0` (or a constant) ⇒
//     identical for every member.
//   * `Owner`: owner-partition-commutative among identical members — owner is NOT
//     controller-invariant, but an owner-keyed partition of identical members
//     composes commutatively (each member's owner-slice is disjoint and the
//     aggregate is order-free), so it needs no member-bound refusal.
