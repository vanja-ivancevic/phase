//! Pre-M10 Wish reach — the legacy rule under which a Wish could retrieve a
//! card its owner had removed from the game.
//!
//! Magic 2010 (July 2009) rewrote the zone model. Today CR 400.11 says
//! "outside the game is not a zone" and CR 400.11a says only a player's
//! sideboard is outside it, so CR 701.23j's "search outside the game for a
//! card" reaches the sideboard and nothing else. Exile is an ordinary in-game
//! zone and a Wish cannot see it.
//!
//! Before M10 there was no exile zone — cards were **removed from the game**,
//! which counted as *outside* it. A Wish could therefore retrieve an owned
//! card that had been removed, and pre-M10 formats are played that way.
//!
//! This module does not implement current CR; it deliberately re-enables
//! behavior the M10 update removed, and only for a custom format that declares
//! [`WishOutsideGameScope::PreM10ReachesExile`]. Every built-in format resolves
//! to the modern default by construction rather than by a check.
//!
//! **The pool it widens to is the one the engine already has.** A pre-M10
//! removed-from-the-game card a Wish could name was, in practice, exactly a
//! card its namer OWNS and can SEE: you cannot choose a card you do not own,
//! and a face-down removed card was never an eligible Wish target. That is
//! precisely what [`OutsideGameSourcePool::SideboardAndFaceUpExile`] already
//! means for the Karn/Coax class — so the legacy rule is expressed by widening
//! a search's *effective* pool to it, not by a second collector.
//!
//! **It applies to EVERY outside-the-game search, uniformly — by design.**
//! The axis is a zone-model choice for the whole game: "removed from the game
//! counts as outside it". It is not a per-card historical property, and it
//! cannot be one. Oracle text is errata'd to modern templating for every card,
//! so wording does not reveal a card's era — *Wish* (2021) and *Burning Wish*
//! (2002) share it — and the engine plays current Oracle text everywhere else.
//! A per-card era authority would make a card's rules depend on its print date
//! in one place only. So under this scope Learn, a 2021 *Wish*, and the Judgment
//! wishes all reach the same pool; under the modern scope none of them do. The
//! bundled presets that declare it have pre-2004 pools, where the question
//! never arises.
