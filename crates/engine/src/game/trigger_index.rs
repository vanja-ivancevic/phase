//! CR 603.2 + CR 603.6a + CR 611.2e: `TriggerIndex` — battlefield-scoped
//! candidate pre-filter for `collect_pending_triggers`. Replaces a full
//! battlefield scan with an event-keyed lookup so trigger-firing cost scales
//! with the number of *relevant* triggers, not with `|battlefield|`.
//!
//! # Correctness model
//!
//! The index maps `TriggerEventKey` → `SmallVec<ObjectId>` ("which permanents
//! could match an event with this shape"). The consult site unions the
//! relevant buckets with `unclassified` and asks each candidate's per-trigger
//! matcher whether it actually matches — the matcher itself is unchanged.
//!
//! Two derivers maintain the index:
//!
//! - `keys_from_event(event, state)`: the keys an event hits at consult time.
//! - `keys_from_trigger_def(def)`: the keys a trigger definition registers
//!   into at maintain time.
//!
//! CR 603.2 over-approximation invariant: it is correctness-preserving to
//! emit more keys than strictly necessary at either site; it is a silent
//! trigger-drop bug to emit fewer. Both derivers are exhaustive `match`es
//! with NO `_` wildcard arms — adding a new `TriggerMode`, `GameEvent`, or
//! `EffectKind` variant is a compile error until the deriver classifies it.
//!
//! # Authority
//!
//! The authoritative correctness path is the rebuild at the end of
//! `evaluate_layers` (CR 611.2e): every continuous-effect-driven mutation of
//! `obj.trigger_definitions` (sliver lords, Changeling, Bramble Sovereign,
//! suppress-triggers statics) flows through the layer pipeline, and
//! `collect_pending_triggers` flushes pending layers before reading the index.
//! The `move_to_zone` incremental hooks are best-effort optimization between
//! layer flushes — they are NOT the safety net.
//!
//! CR 113.6: because those hooks are best-effort and `rebuild_from_battlefield`
//! trusts `state.battlefield` alone (it never reads `obj.zone`), the index can
//! hold an entry for a permanent that has already left the battlefield.
//! `candidates_for_event` therefore filters candidates by the LIVE `obj.zone`
//! before returning them, so the consult honours its own battlefield-candidate
//! contract regardless of how the stale entry arose. This is the same predicate
//! `reindex_object_triggers` enforces on the maintenance side. In
//! `debug_assertions` builds a stale entry panics with the object id, its live
//! zone, and the event; in release builds — including the `server-release`
//! profile the multiplayer server ships, which inherits
//! `debug-assertions = false` — it is corrected silently and recorded only by a
//! `tracing::warn!` on the drop path. That log line is the sole recurrence
//! evidence on the SERVER; `engine-wasm` initialises no `tracing` subscriber, so
//! the browser build records nothing at all.
//!
//! SCOPE: this contains the TRIGGER consequence of the desync, not the desync.
//! The underlying maintenance defect is not found. If the disagreement is
//! "still in `state.battlefield`, live zone elsewhere", then every other
//! consumer of `state.battlefield` — the CR 704 SBA pass, combat declaration,
//! `game/filter.rs` battlefield queries, and the rendered board — still treats
//! the object as a permanent. Only the trigger path is guarded here.
//! Reconciling at `battlefield_phased_in_ids` would contain all consumers at one
//! seam; that is deliberately out of scope for this change.
