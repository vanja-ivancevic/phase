//! Backs `Effect::RevealFromHand { filter, on_decline }`. Used by any "you may
//! reveal a [FILTER] card from your hand" pattern — notably the reveal-land
//! cycle (Port Town, Gilt-Leaf Palace, Temple of ...) where the alternative is
//! "[source] enters tapped." The primitive is not land-specific: the
//! `on_decline` ability is any composable chain, so symmetric "if you do,
