/// Scope: `TargetFilter::SelfRef` (resolves to `ability.source_id`),
/// `ParentTarget` (chained reveal), and pre-resolved `TargetRef::Object` targets
/// are supported via the shared 3-tier `resolved_targets` dispatch. "Reveal
/// target <object>" (Hauntwoods Shrieker) resolves its `Typed` filter through
/// the targeting pipeline, which populates `ability.targets` before this
/// resolver runs, so the targeted object is read here as a pre-resolved object.
///
/// Emits a single `GameEvent::CardsRevealed` carrying all revealed card ids and names.
///
/// Per CR 701.20b, revealing a card does not cause it to change zones or otherwise
/// move — this resolver is read-only against game state.
///
/// Timing note (used by shuffle-back replacements per CR 614 + 701.20): when this
/// runs as a post-replacement effect after a redirected ZoneChange, the card has
/// already landed in its owner's library. The emitted event carries both
/// `card_ids` and `card_names`, so observers see which card caused the shuffle-back
/// regardless of the current zone.
