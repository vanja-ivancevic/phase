//! Heist — designed-for-digital (MTG Arena) keyword action.
//!
//! Heist is NOT in the Comprehensive Rules; it operates per the Arena programmed
//! rules. Reminder text: *"Look at three random nonland cards from target
//! opponent's library. Exile one of them face down. You may cast that card for
//! as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana
//! of any type to cast that spell."* It is also a crime against the targeted
//! opponent.
//!
//! Two cohesive phases share this module:
//!
//! - [`Heist`](crate::types::ability::Effect::Heist) — the look step. Resolves
//!   the targeted opponent, draws `look_count` (default 3) random nonland cards
//!   from their library with the seeded RNG, and surfaces a
//!   [`WaitingFor::ChooseFromZoneChoice`] over those candidates. A
//!   [`HeistExile`](crate::types::ability::Effect::HeistExile) continuation is
//!   stashed so the existing zone-choice answer handler finalizes the pick. The
//!   candidates never leave the library during the look — only the chosen card
//!   is moved by the finalizer, so the unchosen cards are untouched (CR-faithful
//!   to "exile one of them").
//!
//! - [`HeistExile`](crate::types::ability::Effect::HeistExile) — the finalizer
//!   continuation. The chosen card (carried on `ability.targets` by the answer
//!   handler) is exiled from its owner's library, turned face down (CR 406.3),
//!   linked to the source with a look link bound to the heister, who looked at
//!   it and exiled it face down (CR 406.3), and granted a permanent
//!   [`PlayFromExile`](crate::types::ability::CastingPermission::PlayFromExile)
//!   permission with any-type-or-color mana. The controller may then cast that
//!   card for as long as it remains exiled.
