//! CR 103.1 + CR 101.4: Resolver for `Effect::ReverseTurnOrder` — flips the
//! game's turn-order direction (Aeon Engine, Time Distortion, Temple of Atropos).
//!
//! Physical seating is unchanged; only turn progression (CR 103.1), APNAP
//! ordering (CR 101.4), and priority passing (CR 117.3d) reverse, all keyed on
//! `state.turn_direction`. In a two-player game the reversal is a no-op (both
//! directions yield the same opponent); the observable effect is multiplayer.
