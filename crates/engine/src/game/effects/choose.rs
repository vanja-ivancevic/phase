    //     resolution announce". Reads `state.chosen_color_this_resolution`
    //     (written below by the exact-object binding path), falling back to
    //     `chosen_color()` for a linked anaphoric reader whose own chooser was
    //     suppressed.
    //   - `GameObject::current_chosen_color()` — "the current answer". Newest
    //     (last match): `game/filter.rs`'s two `IsChosenColor` arms and
    //     `game/effects/prevent_damage.rs`'s prevention-shield read all want the
    //     most recent choice, not the historical one.
    //
    // CR 400.7 covers why the list can hold more than one entry at all: a spell
    // recast after returning from the graveyard (Wash Out via Regrowth,
    // Prismatic Strands via flashback) is a NEW object, and `chosen_attributes`
    // is cleared only by `reset_for_battlefield_entry` (game/game_object.rs),
    // which a spell never reaches — so a second `Choose a color.` on the same
    // permanent (Mother of Runes or Knight of Dawn re-activating) and a second
    // cast of the same spell both add a second entry rather than overwrite the
    // first.
    //
    // Deliberately Color-only: `Keyword` (the arm above) and `CounterKind` stay
    // current-only replace-on-rechoose because their only readers want the
    // current answer and gain nothing from a history; `CardName` / `CreatureType`
