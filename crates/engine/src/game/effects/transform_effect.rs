    // written), which for a `Dig`/`Reveal` parent is an OFF-BATTLEFIELD card —
    // the looked-at library card for Runo and Delver, and for Sidequest the card
    // its `ChangeZone` parent has already moved to hand. Reading
    // `ability.targets` positionally made THAT card the subject instead of the

    // battlefield, so the printed transform never happened (issue #8586: Runo
    // Stromkirk, Delver of Secrets, Sidequest: Catch a Fish).
    //
    // `targeting::resolved_targets` is the engine's single authority for the
    // self-ref → event-context → chosen-targets ladder, and its `SelfRef` arm
    // short-circuits BEFORE the `ability.targets` fallback for exactly this
    // reason (its own doc comment names this failure mode). Every other
    // subject-resolving effect module already goes through it, directly or via
    // `effects::resolved_battlefield_object_ids`; this brings `Transform` onto
    // the same authority rather than filtering the chain's target vector, which
    // is ALSO the carrier its own descendants read (a chain-layer filter was
    // measured regressing Necrotic Plague's nested Attach → ParentTarget).
    //
    // NOT `effects::resolved_battlefield_object_ids`, which is this exact
    // pairing PLUS a zone-scan fallback. Two independent reasons, and the FIRST
    // is the load-bearing one:
    //   (1) For a STALE `SelfRef` the explicit set is empty, so that helper
    //       falls through to its zone scan — and the scan re-admits the source
    //       BY ID through `matches_target_filter`'s `SelfRef` arm
    //       (-> `object_matches_trigger_source`, which performs NO incarnation
    //       check). Reusing the composed helper would therefore SILENTLY DEFEAT
    //       the CR 400.7 guard this module exists to enforce.
    //   (2) Its own CR 601.2c / CR 608.2b comment reserves that scan for
    //       non-targeted forms, naming `SelfRef` first; here the required
    //       behaviour is the INVERSE (CR 400.7: a stale self-reference must
    //       transform NOTHING), and for a `Typed` filter the scan would perform
    //       a battlefield-wide mass transform the card never printed (that is
    //       `resolve_all`'s job, and it returned above).
    let subjects = super::resolved_effect_object_ids(state, ability, &single_target);

    // CR 400.7 + CR 603.7c: a delayed transform whose pinned referent became a
    // new object transforms nothing — but that guard governs ONLY a referent
    // this ability actually took from `ability.targets`. After the resolution
    // above, a `SelfRef` subject comes from `ability.source_id`, so a FOREIGN
    // chain-injected target whose pin went stale must not veto it (CR 201.5:
    // the printed name binds the source, and another object's history cannot
    // speak to it).
    //
    // THE TEST BELOW IS BY VALUE IDENTITY, NOT BY PROVENANCE, and the name is a
    // shorthand — read it as "every subject also appears among the declared
    // targets". It cannot distinguish "this subject CAME FROM `ability.targets`"
    // from "this `SelfRef` subject HAPPENS ALSO to appear there", which is the
    // real shape a chain parent that targeted the source itself produces. That
    // overlap is harmless in BOTH directions, which is why value identity is
    // sufficient here:
    //   * source STALE  -> `resolved_targets` returns an empty list, `subjects`
    //     is empty, `.all()` is vacuously true, the guard fires, and the no-op
    //     is the CORRECT outcome (CR 400.7).
    //   * source LIVE   -> `pinned_object_targets_all_stale` is false (the
    //     source's own pin is current), the guard does NOT fire, and the
    //     transform happens — also correct.
    // Do not "strengthen" this into a provenance check: there is no provenance
    // to read. Those two bullets are the shapes this guard EXISTS for, but they
    // are NOT an exhaustive partition: `self_ref_is_current` can report a
    // LATCHED trigger source as current while the pinned incarnation read here
    // is already stale, which is a third shape neither bullet describes. That
    // shape is SAFE rather than impossible — it lands on a conservative no-op,
    // either here or at the `stale_self_transform` check below, which re-tests
    // the source through `source_is_current` (CR 400.7). So there is no defect,
    // but do not reason from the two bullets as if nothing else can occur.
    //
    // PLACEMENT IS STILL LOAD-BEARING, in the mirrored direction: for a subject
    // that DID come from `ability.targets`, this must NO-OP rather than REBIND.
    // `resolved_targets` drops pin-stale entries for `ParentTarget` (via
    // `live_object_targets`), which empties `subjects`; without this guard the
    // `[]` arm below would resolve to `ability.source_id` and transform the
    // ability's OWN SOURCE. "No target declared" and "the declared referent went
    // stale" must not collapse into the same OUTCOME.
    //
    // An all-empty `subjects` satisfies `.all()` VACUOUSLY — that is deliberate,
    // it is exactly the `ParentTarget`-went-stale case this must catch, and it is
    // safe because `pinned_object_targets_all_stale` itself requires a non-empty
    // `target_incarnations` AND at least one object target, so it fails closed on
    // an ability that pinned nothing.
    //
    // Scoped to `EffectScope::Single` by construction: the `All` branch returned
    // above into `resolve_all`, a non-targeting battlefield sweep with no
    // referent to pin.
    //
    // `flip_permanent.rs` (CR 701.28a: converting follows CR 701.27a–f) CARRIES
    // THE SAME DEFECT, STILL LIVE. This is a DEFERRAL, NOT A DIVERGENCE: the two
    // modules are not making different choices, one of them simply has not been
    // fixed yet. It is the SAME MECHANISM, not an analogous one —
    // `effects/mod.rs`'s `inject_last_revealed_targets` writes
    // `last_revealed_ids` into any sub's `targets`, and `flip_permanent.rs` then
    // reads `ability.targets.as_slice()` POSITIONALLY, so an injected
    // off-battlefield card displaces the printed self-reference exactly as it
    // did here. `game::flip::flip_permanent` no-ops on an object that is not on
    // the battlefield (CR 710.2), so the printed flip is silently lost.
    //
    // MEASURED, with the bare two-instruction probe:
    //   "At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top card of your library.
    //    Flip this creature."                     -> flipped = false  (DEFECT)
    //   "At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
    //    Flip this creature."                     -> flipped = true   (control)
    // Both runs reached the seam (trigger fired, drive stopped in the upkeep
    // step, `back_face` installed; the defect run looked at exactly one card),
    // so the `false` is a real miss and not an unreached fixture.
    //
    // CORPUS CARDS with the vulnerable shape — `FlipPermanent { target: SelfRef }`
