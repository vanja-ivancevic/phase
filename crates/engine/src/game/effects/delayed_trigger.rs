///   `Not { Any }` and installs a trigger that can never fire.)
/// - `ParentTargetSlot { .. }`: never reaches this binder. `bind_parent_slots_from_root`

    /// drive it, and a test that cannot be driven from a card is the one place a
    /// hand-built ability is the honest instrument rather than a shortcut.
    ///
    /// Both conditions are bound by the same `bind_contextual_filter_to_condition`
    /// call, whose empty-parent rewrite turns `ParentTarget` into
    /// `TargetFilter::Any`. The guard above therefore has to see both, or a
    /// `WhenNextEvent` with a bare `ParentTarget` and no chosen target installs a
    /// trigger that fires on every matching event instead of on one object.
    ///
    /// The EXTENSION's refusal path is not reached by any card today. The older
    /// `WheneverEvent` arm's INPUT SHAPE is live (MEASURED: 15 corpus cards carry
    /// a bare `ParentTarget` in a `WheneverEvent` trigger filter, across
    /// `valid_card` and `valid_source`), so the `(false, false)` case below is a
    /// printed shape rather than an invention. Whether one of those 15 reaches
    /// the refusal with an empty `ability.targets` is UNMEASURED — the same gap
    /// this file states for the four filter-carrying variants, held to the same
    /// standard. For `WhenNextEvent` the only corpus
    /// carriers are the two cards this PR itself creates, and both resolve with
    /// non-empty `ability.targets`, so that half is unreachable from a printed
    /// card. The extension exists so the parser-side decline (a
    /// chain with no declared object referent is left unwrapped) stays TRUE if a
    /// card ever does reach it — it is the fail-closed floor under that decision,
    /// not coverage of a live defect.
    ///
    /// Both directions, because either half alone is trivially satisfiable: a
    /// guard that refuses everything passes the first assertion, one that refuses
    /// nothing passes the second. Both directions run over BOTH conditions —
    /// an earlier version ran the positive control on `WhenNextEvent` only, which
    /// a guard refusing every `WheneverEvent` unconditionally would still pass.

    /// Not covered, and named rather than implied: the `or_trigger` slot that
    /// this arm also feeds through the same rewrite. MEASURED over the corpus, no
    /// `WhenNextEvent.or_trigger` in the corpus carries a `ParentTarget` or
    /// `ParentTargetSlot` filter, so there is nothing to drive it with today.
