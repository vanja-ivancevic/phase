//! CR 702.50: Epic. When an Epic spell resolves, two linked effects begin and
//! last for the rest of the game:
//!
//! * CR 702.50b — its controller can't cast spells (but may still activate
//!   abilities, and effects may still put spell copies onto the stack);
//! * CR 702.50a — at the beginning of each of that player's upkeeps, they copy
//!   the spell except for its epic ability, optionally choosing new targets.
//!
//! This module mirrors Rebound (`game/effects/rebound.rs`): an on-resolution
//! arming hook records the effect and an upkeep-keyed trigger replays it. Two
//! differences make it Epic:
//!
//! 1. **Persistence.** Epic lasts "for the rest of the game", so the record is
//!    stored in the persistent `GameState::epic_effects` collection (never
//!    purged at cleanup, like `city_blessing`) rather than as a stored
//!    `DelayedTrigger` — those are removed at end-of-turn cleanup (`turns.rs`
//!    keeps only `one_shot && !WhenNextEvent`), which would delete a recurring
//!    rest-of-game trigger before its first upkeep ever arrived.
//! 2. **Synthesized firing.** At the beginning of each of the controller's
//!    upkeeps, [`epic_upkeep_trigger`] synthesizes an [`Effect::EpicCopy`]
//!    triggered ability from the stored snapshot, fired through the normal
//!    delayed-trigger path (`triggers::check_delayed_triggers`). Resolving that
//!    body puts a copy of the spell onto the stack (CR 707.10).
//!
//! The copy keeps the snapshot's declared targets: CR 702.50a's "you may choose
//! new targets" is an optional permission whose default — keeping the original
//! (still-legal) targets — is itself a legal choice.
