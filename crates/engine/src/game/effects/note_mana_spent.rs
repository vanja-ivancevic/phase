/// CR 106.1b + CR 602.2b + CR 608.2c: `Effect::NoteManaSpent` — record the mana
/// type(s) spent to pay this resolving ability's own activation cost onto its
/// source as `ChosenAttribute::NotedManaSpent` ("Note the type of mana spent to
/// pay this activation cost" — Jeweled Amulet; Ice Cauldron's "note the type
/// AND AMOUNT…" wording lowers to the same effect). The stored value is the
/// exact per-unit payment, so the reader chooses one type
/// (`ManaProduction::NotedType`) or every noted unit
/// (`ManaProduction::NotedTypeAndAmount`).
///
/// Composable building block: cost payment stays in the mana-payment funnel;
/// `push_ability_entry` (the single authority where an activated ability
/// reaches the stack) snapshots what was spent, paired with the source's
/// incarnation at that moment, directly onto THIS activation's own
/// `ResolvedAbility::noted_mana_payment` (issue #6504) — never a per-object
/// mutable field, so a permanent untapped and reactivated with a different
/// payment while this ability still sits unresolved on the stack cannot
/// corrupt what this instance observed. This effect is the persistent writer,
/// read back by `ManaProduction::NotedType` / `ManaProduction::NotedTypeAndAmount`.
/// Doing the write at resolution —
/// not at payment time — means a countered or otherwise removed-from-stack
/// ability never notes anything (CR 608.2c: instructions are followed only on
/// resolution).
///
/// "The last noted type" is singular per card, so this replaces any prior
/// `ChosenAttribute::NotedManaSpent` before pushing (replace-on-rechoose).
///
/// CR 400.7: a source that leaves and returns (bounce/flicker) while this
/// SAME activation is still unresolved on the stack becomes a new object at
/// the same storage id — a new incarnation with no memory of the old
/// payment. Refuses to write unless the object's current incarnation still
/// matches `noted_mana_payment.source_incarnation`, mirroring the engine's
/// existing incarnation-pairing idiom (`ResolvedAbility::source_is_current`,
/// `TargetFilter::SelfRef` resolution).
