//! CR 701.38: Vote — Council's dilemma family.
//!
//! Each player, starting with a specified player and proceeding in turn order
//! (CR 101.4), chooses one of the listed options. After every player has cast
//! their votes, the per-choice sub-effects resolve once for each vote tallied
//! against that choice.
//!
//! CR 701.38d: A player who has multiple votes (granted by a static ability
//! such as Tivit's "While voting, you may vote an additional time") makes
//! those choices at the same time they would otherwise have voted.
//!
//! The resolver entry point sets `WaitingFor::VoteChoice` for the starting
//! voter, embeds `per_choice_effect` directly on the `WaitingFor` (so the
//! tally flows through state filtering and live multiplayer echoes without
//! reaching back into the source ability), and stashes only the parent's
//! post-Vote sub_ability on a pending continuation. The
//! `engine_resolution_choices.rs` handler tallies each vote, advances voters
//! in APNAP order, and finally calls `resolve_tally` to fan out the per-choice
//! sub-effects.
