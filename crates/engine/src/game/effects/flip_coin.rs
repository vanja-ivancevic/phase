    // Ral's trigger is `FlipCoin { win_effect, lose_effect }` carried on an
    // `AbilityDefinition` whose own `sub_ability` is the return-transformed
    // `ChangeZone` gated by `IfYouDo`. `win_effect` is an OPTIONAL
    // `ChangeZone(Exile, SelfRef)` ("you may exile Ral"). The handler used to
    // rebuild the branch with the lossy `ResolvedAbility::new`, dropping
    // `win_effect.optional` so the player was never prompted and the
    // return-transformed chain never keyed off the exile. These tests drive the
    // genuine resolution pipeline (`build_resolved_from_def` → `resolve_ability_chain`,
    // exactly as `game/triggers.rs` + `game/stack.rs` do) and the genuine
    // `apply(DecideOptionalEffect)` pipeline, with the RNG deterministically
    // seeded for a win or a loss.
