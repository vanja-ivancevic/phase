    //     ability's source). Issue #1520: accepting the optional "cast it?"
    //     prompt appeared to do nothing because only a permission was stamped —
    //     the spell was never put on the stack, and a sorcery like Treasure
    //     Cruise was additionally blocked by the sorcery-speed timing gate at
    //     upkeep.
    //   - CR 701.23 + CR 608.2g (tutor-and-cast): Bring to Light tutors a card into the
    //     controller's OWN exile, then "you may cast it without paying its mana
    //     cost." The tutored card is NOT the source (target != source) and sits
    //     in the controller's own exile, so the Suspend-specific
    //     `target == source` defense and the foreign-graveyard defense below
    //     both miss it. Issue #2880: it fell to `grant_lingering_permissions`,
    //     which stamped an indefinite `ExileWithAltCost { duration: None }` —
    //     a free-cast permission that persists forever instead of being a
    //     one-shot resolution offer.
    //
    // Drive the cast immediately through the same cast-during-resolution
    // authority Cascade/Discover use (`initiate_cast_during_resolution`).
    //
    // The router reads the EXPLICIT `driver` discriminator
    // (`CastFromZoneDriver::DuringResolution`), NOT `duration`. `duration` is
    // CR 611.2a permission-expiry and says nothing about the casting mechanism;
    // routing on it conflated two axes. The structural-shape guard here
    // (`without_paying` + no alt-cost + single target) gates only the DIRECT
    // free-cast path: when it holds, the during-resolution cast of that single
    // card is free, since `initiate_cast_during_resolution` defaults a `None`
    // `alt_mana_cost` to zero. A `DuringResolution` body is NOT universally a
    // free cast, though — when the body carries an `alt_ability_cost` (The Face
    // of Boe's borrowed Suspend cost, CR 118.9 + CR 702.62a), this guard's
    // `alt_ability_cost.is_none()` clause fails and the cast is routed through
    // the resolution-time hand pick (`complete_hand_pick_cast_from_zone`), which
    // threads the resolved non-zero `alt_mana_cost` into
    // `initiate_cast_during_resolution`. The Suspend-era
    // `target == source` clause is intentionally dropped: every existing
    // `DuringResolution` producer (Suspend) uses `target: SelfRef`, so
    // `target == source` still holds for them, and the tutor-and-cast producer
    // (Bring to Light, `target != source` but in the controller's own exile)
    // must reach this path.
    //
    // FOLLOW-UP (#1520 twin): Rebound (CR 702.88a) is still a
    // `LingeringPermission` driver because its recast permission legitimately
    // needs `duration: Some(UntilEndOfTurn)` to prune on decline (see the
    // `consuming_vapors_rebound` suite). A rebounding SORCERY recast at upkeep
    // therefore still passes through the lingering path; whether it hits the
    // sorcery-speed gate is tracked separately. Routing Rebound through
    // `DuringResolution` would regress that durational-prune contract, so it is
    // intentionally left on the permission path under the explicit `driver`
    // signal rather than forced through during-resolution here.
    //
    // Nashi/Jeleva-style "you may cast [other] exiled cards" (target != source,
