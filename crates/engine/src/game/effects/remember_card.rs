/// has all activated and triggered abilities of the last chosen card" — Koh, the
/// Face Stealer) then reads it via `TargetFilter::ChosenCard`.
///
/// Composable building block: `ChooseFromZone` owns the choice UI / zone search
/// and publishes its pick to the resolution chain's tracked set; this effect is
/// the persistent writer. The `target` filter names the chosen object(s) — Koh
/// passes `TrackedSet { id: TrackedSetId(0) }`, the sentinel for "the most recent
/// tracked set", bound here via [`resolve_tracked_set_sentinel`].
///
/// "The last chosen card" is singular: exactly one `ChosenAttribute::Card` is
/// stored, replacing any prior one (replace-on-rechoose), so the grant always
/// tracks the single latest choice. Storing it in `chosen_attributes` means it is
/// cleared automatically when the source changes zones (CR 400.7), which is
/// exactly the lifetime Koh's grant requires.
