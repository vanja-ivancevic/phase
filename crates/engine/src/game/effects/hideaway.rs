//! Hideaway conceal step (CR 702.75a).
//!
//! The chosen card has just been exiled (face up) by the preceding `Effect::Dig`
//! step of a Hideaway ETB ability (`database/hideaway.rs`); the `DigChoice`
//! resolution bound that card onto this sub-ability's targets. This resolver
//! finishes CR 702.75a's exile clause by:
//!
//! - turning the exiled card **face down** (CR 406.3 — a card exiled face down
//!   can't be examined by any player except where an instruction allows it), and
//! - **linking it to the source** in the persistent `exile_links` pool
//!   (CR 607.2a / CR 406.6) so the card's companion "you may play the exiled
//!   card …" ability (`TargetFilter::ExiledBySource`) can later play it, and so
//!   `visibility.rs` lets the link's live rule and its CR 406.3 latch of every
//!   player once admitted look at the card.
//!
//! This is a continuation step, never announced as a targeted effect: its target
//! is `TargetFilter::ParentTarget`, inherited from the `Dig` continuation.
