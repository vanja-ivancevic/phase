    // format placed whatever sat in the `commander` slot, and nothing was ever
    // netted. This introduces both the netting and a deliberate narrowing of
    // placement to formats whose command zone holds a decklist card. Two
    // pre-existing tests had to declare `FormatConfig::commander()` to keep
    // passing; that is the narrowing, made visible.
    //
    // The predicate is `command_zone_holds_decklist_commander`, NOT
    // `uses_commander`. `uses_commander` is `command_zone &&
    // commander_damage_threshold.is_some()` — it answers "does CR 903.10a
    // commander damage apply", not "does the command zone hold a decklist
    // card". Tiny Leaders and Oathbreaker seat a real commander card in the
    // command zone with no damage threshold, so `uses_commander` is `false`
    // for both while `deck_validation.rs` nets them with
    // `CommandZoneNetting::NetAgainstMainDeck`. Narrowing on `uses_commander`
    // instead WOULD leave a legal Oathbreaker or Tiny Leaders deck's commander
    // in the library AND unplaced in the command zone, while the validator had
    // already netted it out of the deck-size check — the two would disagree
    // about the same card. That is the trap this predicate exists to avoid, not
    // a bug that shipped. `FormatConfig::command_zone` is not the predicate
    // either:
    // Archenemy (CR 904.3 + CR 904.4: the scheme deck lives in the command
    // zone) and Momir have a command zone that holds no
    // decklist card at all, so netting on it would delete a library card.
    //
    // Called on the RESOLVED config, not the bare `GameFormat`: a Custom
    // format is answered from its own `CommandZoneMode`. Deriving Custom from
    // `uses_commander` would reopen exactly that trap for Custom, since
    // `for_custom_rules` sets `uses_commander` from the declared
