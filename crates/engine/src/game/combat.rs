/// (`quantity::defending_player_for_quantity_context`), the quantity-context
/// controller-ref door (`quantity::source_defending_player_for_context`), and

/// calls THIS FUNCTION WITH THESE THREE ARGUMENTS AND NOTHING ELSE, so one

///
/// # The one binding rule (stated once, applied here only)
///
/// An attack event binds a "defending player" reference **if and only if** the
/// reference is being evaluated inside the scope of a triggered ability — i.e.
/// `trigger_source.is_some()`. CR 603.4: a triggered ability is bound to the
/// event that fired it, and that event is authoritative for its anaphors. A
/// layer/static read, an activated ability, or any filter evaluated outside a
/// triggered ability's scope is bound to NOTHING and must answer from the
/// asker's own combat facts only — otherwise an unrelated in-flight
/// `AttackersDeclared` leaks its attacker into a continuous effect's filter.
///
/// When bound, the event is the explicit DETECTION event (the
/// `DETECTION_TRIGGER_EVENT` TLS, set by `resolve_quantity_for_trigger_check`
/// whenever an explicit `event` is supplied) if one is present, else
/// `state.current_trigger_event`. Same precedence, and same reason, as the
/// `scoped_player` derivation in `resolve_quantity_for_trigger_check`:
/// `current_trigger_event` may still hold a stale event from an unrelated
/// in-flight resolution in the same step (issue #1323). Reading both here,
/// rather than in the doors, is what makes the rule unforgeable.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `asker_id` — the object whose ability is asking, as the caller knows it.
/// * `trigger_source` — the triggered ability's source context, or `None`. Both
///   the LATCH (`combat_status.defending_player`, captured by
///   `zones::capture_combat_status` — the CR 508.5 LAST clause / CR 608.2h last
///   known information, `None` when the asker is not itself an attacker) and
///   the binding decision are derived from this ONE input. A captured `None`
///   means "no answer here", not "no defender" (issue #6678): an
///   Equipment/Aura source is absent from `combat.attackers`, so the chain must
///   fall through rather than collapse to a spurious `Some(None)`.
///
/// Two ids are derived internally and must not be conflated: the ENTRY-LOOKUP
/// id is `trigger_source`'s LKI reference id when present, else `asker_id`
/// (matching the pre-change quantity `Some` branch); the LIVE-COMBAT id is
/// always `asker_id` (matching the pre-change filter door and quantity `None`
/// branch).
///
/// # Precedence
///
/// 1. The asker's OWN entry in the bound event's `attacks` list. CR 508.5 first
///    clause — "an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending
///    player". Resolved through [`defending_player_for_target_or`], so a
///    planeswalker target answers with its controller and a battle target with
///    its protector (CR 310.9d) instead of being skipped.
/// 2. The bound event's SOLE attacker, when the event names exactly one.
///
///    **THIS STEP EXISTS TO OUTRANK THE LATCH (step 3), NOT TO RESOLVE THE
///    ATTACK TARGET. DO NOT COLLAPSE IT INTO STEP 4.**
///
///    CR 508.5 second clause — "a spell or ability refers to both an attacking
///    creature and a defending player": on an observer trigger, the attacking
///    creature the ability refers to is the one the event names, EVEN IF the
///    asker is itself attacking someone else. The latch (step 3) is the CR
///    508.5 LAST-clause LKI snapshot of the ASKER's own attack; the second
///    clause beats it whenever the event names the referred-to attacker.
///
///    Note that `trigger_matchers::matching_attack_events` already writes the
///    per-target-RESOLVED defender into each synthesized singleton's global
///    `defending_player` field, so step 2 and step 4 return the SAME `PlayerId`
///    on the production path. The only thing step 2 adds is its POSITION —
///    ahead of the latch. Merging it into step 4 restores latch-before-event
///    and re-breaks the observer-trigger anaphor; the M'Baku integration test
///    `mbaku_buffs_only_the_creature_attacking_the_monarch` and the unit test
///    `event_sole_attacker_outranks_source_latch_cr_508_5` are what fail.
/// 3. The latch. Reached when the bound event names neither the asker nor a
///    sole attacker (a raw multi-attacker batch), or when there is no bound
///    event at all. Not dead code — `raw_batch_without_asker_falls_back_to_latch`
///    pins it.
/// 4. The bound event's declared global `defending_player` (CR 508.1b). The
///    coarsest answer; reachable only for a raw batch, and only inside a
///    triggered ability's scope (an unbound reference never reaches here).
/// 5. [`resolve_defending_player`] — live combat, keyed on `asker_id`. The
///    pre-existing tail; note it retains its OWN
///    `triggering_event_source_object` fallback, which this change does not
///    touch.
///
/// # Behavior deltas
///
/// This CHANGES precedence at four of the six (door × trigger-source state)
/// combinations; it is NOT a pure `.or_else` extension of any caller and no
/// parity invariant is claimed. In particular, with no bound event the result
/// is now `None` rather than an unrelated in-flight combat's global defender —
/// that leak removal is deliberate, and on the trigger side the designation
/// boundary gate turns the resulting `None` into a non-firing condition in both
/// polarities.
