//! CR 710: Flip cards (Kamigawa block).
//!
//! A flip card is a **single-faced** card with a two-part frame. Its top half
//! carries the normal characteristics (CR 710.1a); its bottom half carries an
//! alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness that apply only
//! while the permanent is on the battlefield **and** flipped (CR 710.1b).
//!
//! Flipping is therefore NOT transforming: CR 701.27a restricts transforming to
//! permanents represented by double-faced cards/tokens, and CR 710.1c fixes a
//! flip card's color and mana cost across the flip where transforming swaps
//! them. This module keeps its own applicator ([`apply_flipped_face_to_object`])
//! for exactly that reason — reusing the double-faced applicator
//! (`printed_cards::apply_back_face_to_object`) would swap mana cost and color
//! and break CR 710.1c.
//!
//! Not modeled here, deliberately:
//! - CR 710.5 — a player choosing a flip card's *alternative* name for a
//!   "choose a card name" effect. That is a name-choice-menu concern, not a
//!   permanent-status concern, and no current name-choice path consults
//!   alternative faces.
//! - CR 110.5b's "unless a spell or ability says otherwise" entry override,
//!   i.e. Homura, Human Ascendant's "return it to the battlefield flipped".
//!   That is an entry-time replacement rider (the flip-card analogue of
//!   `enter_transformed`), not a flip instruction, and it is the only printed
//!   card in the class. Every permanent therefore enters unflipped, which
//!   [`revert_flip_on_zone_exit`] already guarantees on every zone exit.
//! - Turning a *face-down* flipped permanent back FACE UP (CR 708.8) restores
//!   the NORMAL half, not the alternative one. `GameObject` has a single
//!   `back_face` slot, and a flipped permanent that is turned face down
//!   (Ixidron, Cyber Conversion) must keep the normal half there so the
//!   CR 710.2 zone-exit result stays correct (see `effects::turn_face_down`
//!   and the ordering note in `zones::apply_zone_exit_cleanup`). The
//!   alternative half is therefore not recoverable on a later turn-up; the
//!   permanent's `flipped` status is still retained (CR 710.4 — flipping is
//!   one-way and is never cleared while the permanent stays on the
//!   battlefield). Storing both halves at once needs a second stash slot,
//!   which is a `GameObject`/serialization change beyond this module.
//! - CR 707.3's *second-order* flip copy case (CR 110.5c's Dimir Doppelganger
//!   example): a permanent that is ALREADY flipped and then becomes a copy of
//!   another flip card should show the copied card's ALTERNATIVE half. The
//!   copy pipeline installs copiable values only (CR 707.2 — the normal half,
//!   see [`flipped_normal_copiable_values`]) and never re-derives the copied
//!   card's other half, which again needs a second stash slot.
