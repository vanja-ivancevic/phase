//! CR 702.47: Splice onto [subtype] — reveal a card from hand and copy its text
//! box onto a spell of the matching subtype you're casting, paying its splice
//! cost as an additional cost.
//!
//! Splice is announced during CR 601.2b (as the spell is cast, before targets
//! and before the total cost is locked), so this module hooks the cast pipeline
//! at the same pre-target seam that Emerge and Casualty use. When the caster
//! reveals a splice card:
//!
//! * its splice cost is added to the host spell's total cost as an additional
//!   cost (CR 702.47a);
//! * its text-box spell ability is cloned and appended to the host spell's
//!   resolved-ability chain (CR 702.47c) so it resolves as part of that spell;
//! * the card is revealed and **stays in the caster's hand** (CR 702.47a).
//!
//! Because the spliced abilities are merged into `PendingCast::ability` *before*
//! target selection, the existing deferred-target machinery
//! ([`casting_costs::begin_deferred_target_selection`]) collects targets for the
//! spliced effects alongside the host spell's own targets (CR 702.47c–d). Any
//! number of cards may be spliced onto one spell (CR 702.47e) — the offer is
//! re-presented after each acceptance until the caster declines or the hand runs
//! out of eligible cards.
