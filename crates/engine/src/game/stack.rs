/// struct destructuring. Field-by-field audit:
/// - `source_id`   — IN KEY via `source_axis` (CR 111.2 + CR 109.4). A base
///   token reads nothing from its source, so `token_effect_is_source_independent`
///   maps it to `SourceIndependent`, collapsing a run across DISTINCT sources
///   (the Scute Swarm O(N²)→O(N) fix). Any source-relative effect maps to
///   `Source(source_id)`, keeping the per-source boundary so two sources never
///   collapse incorrectly.
/// - `ability`     — IN KEY (deep-equal `ResolvedAbility`: identical effect).
/// - `condition`   — RESOLUTION-RELEVANT, NOT in key. CR 603.4: the entry-level
///   intervening-if is rechecked per entry at resolution (`resolve_top`
///   stack.rs:120-140) and the effect is skipped once the condition flips. The
///   batch path applies the effect N times WITHOUT a per-entry recheck, so a
///   run carrying an order-sensitive intervening-if (one the run's own tokens
///   could move across its threshold) would diverge from sequential. We do NOT
///   attempt to prove invariance in v1: any `condition.is_some()` makes the
///   entry NON-batchable, forcing it into a singleton run that falls back to
///   the `resolve_top` path which rechecks correctly. Conservative refuse.
/// - `trigger_event` — IN KEY (event context drives `EventContextAmount`, etc.;
///   differing context must not collapse).
/// - `description` — IN KEY (distinguishes triggers from the same source).
/// - `source_name` — RESOLUTION-IRRELEVANT: a display-only pre-resolved name
///   (game_state.rs:3493-3500) the frontend renders; it derives from
///   `source_id` (already in key) and is never read during resolution. Not in
///   key by design.
/// - `subject_match_count` — RESOLUTION-RELEVANT but PROVABLY EQUAL across a
///   run: it is the CR 603.2c filtered subject count from the firing event
///   batch. `resolve_batched` lifts it into resolution scope from the run's top
///   entry (stack.rs:1135-1145), and `trigger_event` (which carries the firing
///   event) is already in the key — two entries with equal `trigger_event` and
///   equal deep `ability` carry the same batched subject count. It is therefore
///   redundant to key on (would never break a run the other fields kept
///   together) and is correctly applied from the top entry in the batch path.
/// - `die_result` — EXCLUDED for the same reason as `subject_match_count`: it
///   is CR 706.2 resolution data (the carried die-roll result re-stamped from
///   the run's top entry in `resolve_batched`), not run identity. Keying on it
