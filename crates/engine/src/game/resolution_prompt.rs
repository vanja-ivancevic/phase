//! CR 608.2d + CR 616.1 + CR 732.2a — resolution-time choice-freeness.
//!
//! Split out of `game/ability_scan.rs`, which the module header defines as *"a
//! single compiler-exhaustive, wildcard-free walk of a resolved ability's typed
//! AST"* and which contains ZERO references to `GameState` in any form. Probing a
//! resolution needs a board, so threading `&GameState` into that file would break
//! its stated contract. `ResolutionChoiceFreedom`'s own doc already flagged the
//! mismatch: it *"classifies RESOLVER prompting behavior, not AST reads"*.
//!
//! The verdict carries the EVENTS the resolution proposes, not a class name. A
//! name-derived replacement class map was fail-open in two independent ways —
//! it missed defs drawn through a second registry key, and it could not see a
//! virtual candidate at all, because a virtual has no `ReplacementDefinition`.
