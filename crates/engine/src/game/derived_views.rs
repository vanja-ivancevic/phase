///
/// THE ANSWER, not a disclosure: this is not the `Mana(_)` false-promise case. The collapse really
/// IS scheduled for that axis, so the quiet surfaces under-announce; none of them promises a bound

    // WHY THE THREE ∞ SURFACE CHANNELS BELOW ARE UNCONDITIONAL — the accept→boundary window.
    //
    // THE WINDOW'S TIMING IS CR 732.2c'S ADVANCE, NOT A DEVIATION FROM IT. CR 732.2c: once the
    // last player accepts, "the game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game
    // choices contained in the shortcut proposal having been taken". Per CR 732.2a that ending
    // point "must be a place where a player has priority" — so it is NOT the CR 500.5 step/phase
    // end, which is a turn-based action, with priority arriving at the beginning of the next step
    // (CR 117.3a). The count is resolved at accept (`pending_materialization_count`), and the
    // growth lands at the CR 500.5 boundary while the game is still advancing toward that priority
    // window. State AT the ending point is the proposed state. An earlier version of this block
    // called the whole window unlicensed; that conceded rules the code satisfies. The full
    // four-position reading lives at `types/game_state.rs`'s `scheduled_collapse_axes` doc.
    //
    // WHY THE CHANNELS BELOW STILL CARRY `FamilyCollapseState` RATHER THAN A BARE FLAG: being
    // rules-correct about WHEN the loop closes is not the same as knowing WHAT NUMBER will land.
    // The boundary re-checks whether the growth is still observed, and the controller names the
    // count at the ending point (CR 732.2a's "specified number of times"), so the final amount is
    // not knowable while the badge is on screen. `∞→N` is a promise; the engine makes it only for
    // a family whose amount it can already stand behind, and shows `∞→?` otherwise.
    //
    // The two CRs this code does rely on, each for what it actually governs:
    //  • CR 732.2c — the shortcut is taken at the count every player accepted, so the collapse may
    //    not EXCEED it. `turns.rs`' `max:` reads the recorded bound for exactly that reason and
    //    `SubmitPayAmount` rejects an over-collapse. That is a CEILING on the collapse; it says
    //    nothing about what the display may show, and this projection does not read it.
    //  • CR 500.5 — the TIMING LANDMARK only: it defines the step/phase end, at which
    //    until-end-of-step effects expire and unspent mana empties. That mana drain is the one
    //    thing here CR 500.5 genuinely governs (`turns::drain_pending_phase_transition_progress`,
    //    and it is why a `Mana(_)` ∞ ends there). It does NOT license CASHING OUT the deferred
    //    token/life/counter growth at that moment — the engine chose that landmark as the point
    //    along CR 732.2c's advance at which the elided loop closes (CR 732.1b), as described above.
    //
    // WHY `∞` IS RIGHT HERE IS AN ENGINE-STATE ARGUMENT, NOT A RULES ONE. Throughout the window the
    // loop's enabling permanents are still on the battlefield and `unbounded_resources` still
    // carries the mark, so the controller really does still hold a set of actions that could be
    // repeated indefinitely — a CR-732.1b-SHAPED capability, which is the same sense the rest of
    // this crate cites CR 732.1b in. `∞` renders that live mark honestly.
    //
    // WHAT THIS PROJECTION DOES **NOT** CLAIM: that the mark is REVOCABLE for this class. The
    // zone-exit defuse (`zones::apply_zone_exit_cleanup`) is gated on a NON-EMPTY
    // `unbounded_loop_enablers`, and the only production writer of that map is the Interactive
    // Path-C arm (`engine.rs`'s `register_unbounded_loop_enablers` call).
    // `materialize_object_growth_shortcut` never registers enablers, so for the OBJECT-GROWTH class
    // — which is exactly the token and counter families this projection displays — the defuse gate
    // never matches and is INERT. `engine_resolution_choices.rs` documents that gap in those words
    // and tracks it as a pre-existing deferred follow-up; it is not introduced here.
    //
    // CONSEQUENCE, STATED RATHER THAN BURIED: because that defuse is inert for this class, an
    // enabler leaving the battlefield between accept and boundary leaves a STALE `∞` in the STORE.
    // The store is deliberately NOT filtered (the defuse and the boundary both read it), so the
    // live-authority check lives HERE, at the projection: `object_growth_backing` drops a row whose
    // whole registered display set has left the battlefield, exactly as the pile and counter loops
    // already drop individual departed members. That is a DISPLAY revocation only — it never
    // touches `pending_unbounded_materialization`, so the growth the table accepted still lands.
    // Registering enablers instead would route this through `clear_unbounded_loop`, a SIX-map wipe
    // that also destroys the accepted collapse stash and its CR 732.2c bound; see
    // `types::game_state::clear_unbounded_loop`. What ends the MARK for this class is still the
    // boundary, below.
    //
    // And hiding it is strictly worse on display coherence, which is what the old "the badge is a
    // lie" comment was really about. The BASE gate filtered the PROJECTION while the STORE still
    // said `∞` — a HUD contradicting its own engine — and it also suppressed an already-
    // materialized `Mana(_)` axis that `mana_payment::refill_infinite_mana` keeps topping back up,
    // i.e. it hid a badge beside a pool the player can visibly keep spending.
    //
    // NO SURFACE IS FILTERED BY THE SCHEDULE — that, and only that, is the invariant here. Which
    // rows/groups/pills EXIST is decided by the `∞` stores, the object's own counters, and the
    // LIVE battlefield alone; nothing below hides a surface because a collapse is scheduled. That
    // now covers a COMPLETE projection, not just the `∞` subset: `counter_display` publishes every
    // rendered counter row on every object, and the schedule decides the existence of none of
    // them. The schedule may only ANNOTATE (`unbounded_families`), never admit or withhold a row.
    // The schedule is read to ANNOTATE, not
    // to filter: the row loop accumulates a per-`(player, family)` `FamilyCollapseState` emitted as
    // a SEPARATE channel (`unbounded_families`), and NO row carries a flag. Still additive.
    //
    // Phrased as an invariant rather than a census of readers, because the census version has now
    // outlived the code beneath it THREE times:
    //   1. "the surface loops read only their own stores" — falsified by `object_growth_backing`,
    //      which deliberately cross-reads the pile and counter-target stores, because whether a
    //      ROW is still live is a question about those backing sets, not about its own.
    //   2. "no surface reads `scheduled_collapse_axes`" — falsified when the `scheduled` flag
    //      moved into the row loop.
    //   3. "…and the tag loop projects the schedule" — falsified when that channel was removed
    //      for having no consumer; and falsified AGAIN, in the opposite direction, when a separate
    //      schedule channel was REINSTATED because a consumer now exists. The reader is
    //      `unbounded_families`, consumed by `usePlayerDesignations` → `UnboundedBadge` and pinned
    //      on the wire by `unbounded-declined-wire.json`.
    //   4. "…and the schedule rides on each row as a `scheduled` flag" — falsified when that flag
    //      was deleted. A per-FAMILY badge cannot render a per-ROW flag honestly: two same-family
    //      axes that disagree need a third answer, which is what `FamilyCollapseState::Mixed` is.
    //   5. "…and `object_growth_backing` refuses for `Counter(..)`, so only the token axis can
    //      lose a row" — falsified when that arm stopped reading the controller-keyed store WHOLE
    //      and started deriving each registered pair's own axis, which is an axis-scoped
    //      authority and therefore may revoke a counter row too.
    //   6. "…and the counter-pill loop projects only `∞`-marked pairs" — falsified when the
    //      channel widened to the complete per-object projection in `counter_display_views`. `∞`
    //      became an ANNOTATION on a row whose existence is decided by the object's own counters,
    //      and `Finite` row existence stopped being battlefield-gated at all.
    // The gate itself reads the schedule for the first time, and it still does not FILTER by it:
    // an accepted collapse can only ADD a row back that the backing check would have dropped
    // (CR 732.2c — the shortcut is already taken), never remove one.
    // Naming WHO reads the schedule is a claim every future consumer can break; naming what the
    // schedule may not DO is not. The stores are not filtered either:
    // `unbounded_resources` keeps the mark until the boundary applies the growth. (`unbounded_loop_enablers` is held in
    // lockstep with it as an ENGINE-STATE invariant required by no CR — but see the inertness note
    // above: for the object-growth class that map is EMPTY, so the lockstep is vacuously satisfied
    // here and is load-bearing only for the Interactive Path-C class that populates it.)
    //
    // What ends each `∞` is the boundary, never this projection:
    // `clear_collapsed_materializations` drops the collapsed axes once the growth is applied, and
    // `turns::drain_pending_phase_transition_progress` clears a `Mana(_)` axis when the step or
    // phase ends (CR 500.5).

/// coincidence. The `Mana(_)` exclusion below is the ONLY display judgement in the pair, which is
/// what makes the FACT/ANNOUNCEMENT split meaningful at all.
///
/// Named rather than inlined into its one caller because the SCOPE LIMIT below is a rule, not a
/// line of the row loop, and it has already proved it drifts when written twice: an earlier cut of
/// this change had a second consumer (a `scheduled_collapse` tag channel, since removed for having
/// no reader) and the guard lived in that consumer alone, so mana rows shipped flagged while the
/// tag omitted them. Any future second consumer calls THIS, and inherits the limit; a consumer that
/// needs the unfiltered rules answer calls [`accepted_collapse_axes`] instead, and the type it asks
/// for says which of the two it got.
///
/// SCOPE LIMIT — `Mana(_)` is excluded. This is about what the badge would TELL the player, not
/// about which code path ends the axis, and it is scoped to THE WINDOW THE BADGE RENDERS IN
/// (accept → CR 500.5 boundary). Inside that window:
/// - The pool is already unbounded and spendable — `mana_payment::refill_infinite_mana` re-tops it
///   off the store after every action — so the chosen `N` does not bound what the player may
///   spend. "A finite amount will be chosen" is false for this axis while it is true for every
///   deferred one, and the badge is only on screen here.
/// - CR 500.5 ends the badge at the step/phase end when the pool empties, on a schedule the
///   accepted count does not move.
///
/// ACROSS the boundary it is not unconditional, and the sentence above is deliberately not written
/// as if it were: a `DriveSequence` collapse replays the captured sequence `N` times after that
/// empty, so the post-collapse pool genuinely is bounded by `N`. The badge is gone by then.
///
/// THE OTHER OVER-PROMISE — NOW TYPED, NOT DISCLOSED. `Counters` and `Life` axes can be scheduled
/// here and then NOT collapse: the boundary re-runs the observed-growth firewall
/// (`engine_resolution_choices`) and DECLINES the batched apply if a counter/life observer (Heliod,
/// Corpsejack) appeared during the accept→boundary window, and a `Tokens` axis can park on a
/// replacement choice instead. Each kind's answer comes from
/// `engine_resolution_choices::materialization_certainty`, which reads that loop's own non-push-exit
/// census rather than a copy of it, and it lands here as [`CollapseCertainty`]: `Conditional` for
/// the three kinds with a hold, `Committed` only for `DriveSequence`, which cannot park. Witnessed
/// by `combo_infinite_pile::real_4p_counter_observer_drift_in_window_declines_batched_counter_but_still_mints_tokens`.
///
/// It is NOT fixable at flag time — the observer can appear after this projection ran, so no value
/// computed here can be right for the whole window — and THAT is precisely why `Conditional` is a
/// variant rather than an apology: the badge stops promising a bound it cannot keep and says
/// "collapse pending; this may stay unbounded" instead. `Mana(_)` is excluded above because its
/// promise is false the moment it is made; this one can only become false later, which is why the
/// two are handled differently.
///
/// This exclusion answers a DIFFERENT question from the collapse filter at the registration site:
/// what the badge may PROMISE during the accept→boundary window, versus which authority ends the
/// axis. The collapse no longer drops the `Mana(_)` axis at all —
/// `game::engine::materialize_object_growth_shortcut` stores only `DeferredAccrual` axes in a
/// `DriveSequence`'s `collapsed_axes` (`analysis::resource::ResourceAxis::unbounded_mark_kind`),
/// and the batched items never named one — so no `PersistentAxisMaterialization` kind can schedule
/// a `Mana(_)` axis, and this `retain` is a no-op on every production path today.
///

/// `Counter(Plus1Plus1, Creature)` (`analysis::corpus`'s `ResourceFamily::Counters`) and the
/// display channel's object-agnostic `Counter(Other, Other)`, while only the latter's targets
/// are ever registered — so when those targets left the battlefield the guard dropped EVERY
