//! CR 603.3b: PR-6.75 trigger-ordering conflict-gate tests.
//!
//! Two families:
//!   * The §5.2 **allowlist-parity sweep** — the corpus-wide proof that the new
//!     `ability_rw` conflict gate reproduces the DELETED 12-string serde
//!     allowlist's decision on every printed no-ordering-input trigger, modulo
//!     the seven proven-order-dependent category-(1) rows (the CR 603.3b fix).
//!     A FROZEN in-test copy of the deleted walk is the reference oracle.
//!   * The **discriminators** N-A/N-B/N-B2/N-C/N-D/N-F — hand-built groups run
//!     through the production ordering-soundness authority
//!     (`group_is_order_independent`), each paired so exactly one classification
//!     decision is bracketed (revert-fails recorded in the impl report).
//!
//! N-E (the per-arm profile pairings) already lives in `ability_rw`'s unit tests
//! and is NOT duplicated here.
