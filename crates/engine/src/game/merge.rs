//! CR 730 (Merging with Permanents) + CR 702.140 (Mutate).
//!
//! Phase 1 of the Mutate keyword. A mutating creature spell that resolves with a
//! legal target does NOT enter the battlefield (CR 702.140c); instead it merges
//! with the target creature, becoming one object represented by more than one
//! card or token (CR 730.2). This module owns the merge primitive
//! ([`merge_object_onto`]), the leave-the-battlefield split (CR 730.3,
//! [`split_merged_permanent_on_leave`]), and the top/bottom choice handler
//! ([`handle_mutate_merge_choice`]).
//!
//! Merge identity (BINDING review resolution S4):
//!   * The surviving battlefield object is ALWAYS the target creature's
//!     `ObjectId` (CR 730.2c continuity). The merged permanent "is the same
//!     object that it was before."
//!   * Over/under only selects which component supplies copiable characteristics
//!     (CR 730.2a) — recorded as the topmost element of
//!     `GameObject::merged_components` (convention: index `[0]` is topmost).
//!   * The merged permanent always has the UNION of every component's abilities
//!     (CR 702.140e); its other characteristics come from the topmost component
//!     (CR 730.2a).
//!   * Each component retains its ORIGINAL owner so the CR 730.3 leave-split
//!     routes each card/token to the correct player's zone.
//!
//! Multi-instance stacking (CR 730.2) IS supported: mutating onto an
//! already-merged permanent extends its component stack, and the merged
//! permanent's layer-1 copy effect is re-derived from the full stack each time.
//!
//! Face-down components (partial — CR 730.2e): handled now is the merged
//! permanent's status following its topmost component (a face-down topmost keeps
//! the survivor face down; a face-up topmost over a face-down component does NOT
//! count as turning it face up, so no `TurnedFaceUp` event), and the suppression
//! of a non-topmost face-down component's listed characteristics from the
//! copiable-values union (a cloaked/disguised component's `base_keywords = [Ward]`
//! is not inherited by a face-up merged permanent — CR 708.2a + CR 730.2e). Still
//! deferred: CR 730.2f turn-up of a face-down merged permanent; full CR 702.140e
//! reveal of a formerly-face-down bottom component's real abilities on a
//! mutate-over; the split (CR 730.3) of a face-down merge survivor (the survivor's
//! `base_*` holds the stale 2/2 face-down profile rather than the component's real
//! card characteristics); and the extreme corner where a sticker placed on a
//! face-down permanent is wiped by the Layer-1b re-seed (rules-correct per CR
//! 708.2a — a face-down object has only its listed characteristics). Note:
//! `apply_face_down` does not normalize `base_loyalty`/`base_defense`; that is
//! pre-existing Step-1 reset behavior, faithfully preserved by the shared
//! `seed_live_characteristics_from_base` helper.
//!
//! Deferred: copy effects targeting a merged permanent, DFC components, full CR
//! 702.140d downstream reflexive effects, and the CR 730.3a graveyard/library
//! arrange-order UI (a deterministic order is used).
