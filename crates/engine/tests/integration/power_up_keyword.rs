//! Runtime pipeline tests for the Power-up keyword mechanic (MSH/MSC).

//! Power-up is a keyword-labeled activated ability (like Exhaust): `Power-up —
//! {cost}: {effect}`, activatable only once per game, with its activation cost's
//! generic reduced by the source's mana value if it entered this turn. These
//! tests drive the real parse→activation pipeline (`add_creature_from_oracle`
//! re-parses the Oracle text with the new parser; `GameRunner` drives `apply()`),
//! and each carries a revert-failing assertion (not an AST-shape assertion).
//!
//! CR 602.5b: activate only once. CR 602.2b + CR 601.2f + CR 302.6: cost
//! reduced by source MV if it entered this turn. CR 106.6: tag-scoped mana
//! spend restriction (Quinjet). CR 500.7 + CR 514.2: Kang's extra-turn
//! power-up prohibition. CR 603.2c: Marvel Boy's dual-condition trigger
//! fires once for each event.
