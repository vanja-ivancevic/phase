//! CR 810.8a — Two-Headed Giant team propagation for `CantLoseTheGame` /
//! `CantWinTheGame`.
//!
//! CR 810.8a: "Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as
//! individuals. ... If an effect says that a player can't win the game, that
//! player's team can't win the game. If an effect says that a player can't
//! lose the game, that player's team can't lose the game." The Platinum Angel
//! example in the same rule ("Neither that player nor their teammate can lose
//! the game ... neither player on the opposing team can win the game") is the
//! exact clause Angel's Grace prints ("You can't lose the game this turn and
//! your opponents can't win the game this turn").
//!
//! `angels_grace.rs` exercises only two-player fixtures, so it can't
//! distinguish "protects the named player" from "protects the named player's
//! team" — a 1v1 game has no teammate to leave unprotected. These fixtures
//! install the grant on ONE 2HG teammate only (mirroring the transient,
//! `SpecificPlayer`-scoped continuous effect Angel's Grace's resolution
//! installs — see `effect.rs::register_transient_effect`'s player-target
//! branch) and check the OTHER, non-granted teammate — both through the SBA
//! path (`check_state_based_actions`) and the effect-stated path
//! (`resolve_lose` / `resolve_win`), matching the two runtime authorities the
//! review flagged: `sba.rs`'s `player_has_cant_lose` and
//! `static_abilities.rs`'s `player_has_cant_win`.
//!
//! 2HG seating (`FormatConfig::two_headed_giant()`, 4 players): P0+P1 are one
//! team, P2+P3 the other (see `game::topology::teammates`).
