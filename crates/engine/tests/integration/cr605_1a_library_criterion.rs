//! CR 605.1a (2026 amendment) — the library-movement criterion, end to end.
//!
//! > 605.1a An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the
//! > following criteria: it doesn't require a target (see rule 115.6), it could
//! > add mana to a player's mana pool when it resolves, it's not a loyalty
//! > ability (see rule 606, "Loyalty Abilities"), and **its cost and effect
//! > don't move any card to or from a library.**
//!
//! The classifier itself is unit-tested in `game/mana_abilities.rs` (rows
//! V1-V13). This file covers the four consequences that are only observable by
//! driving the real pipeline, and it deliberately asserts **no** AST-internal
//! flag: `is_mana_ability` never appears in an assertion here.
//!
//! | Row | Claim | Seam |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | V14  | a reclassified ability still produces its mana, **via the stack** | `engine.rs` dispatch fork -> `casting::handle_activate_ability` -> `stack::push_to_stack` |
//! | V14b | it leaves the instant-speed auto-tap pool | `mana_sources::activatable_mana_actions_for_player` |
//! | V15  | `FilterProp::HasManaAbility` stops matching it | `game/filter.rs` |
//! | V16  | `TriggerCondition::ActivatedAbilityIsNonMana` now fires on it | `game/triggers.rs` (unchanged code, changed input) |
//!
//! Every negative is paired with a positive reach-guard **in the same test**,
//! built from a still-qualifying mana source on the same battlefield, so a
//! fixture that never reached the seam cannot pass vacuously.
