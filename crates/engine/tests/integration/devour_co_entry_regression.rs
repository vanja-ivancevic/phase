//! Regression for Devour co-entry (CR 702.82 / CR 614.12a / CR 614.13a-b):
//! when one or more Devour creatures enter the battlefield simultaneously with
//! other permanents (via a single `Effect::ChangeZoneAll`), the as-enters Devour
//! sacrifice MUST NOT be able to sacrifice:
//!   * the devourer itself (CR 614.13a — the permanent that's entering),
//!   * any other object entering at the same time (CR 614.13a),
//!   * a co-entering second devourer (CR 614.12a + CR 614.13a — both choices are
//!     made before either devourer "enters", so neither can devour the other).
//!
//! Both tests drive the REAL production `change_zone::resolve_all` path (the same
//! path a "put all creature cards exiled this way onto the battlefield" /
//! reanimation-style `ChangeZoneAll` flows through) with synthetic objects, so
//! they need no card-data and exercise the engine end-to-end. The Devour
//! replacement is constructed to match `database::synthesis::synthesize_devour`.
