//! Runtime discriminators for the dynamic-count top-of-library exile parser arm
//! (`parse_dynamic_exile_from_top` in `parser/oracle_effect/imperative.rs`).
//!
//! The class — "exile [dynamic count] cards from the top of <owner>'s library" —
//! was silently lowered by the generic `ChangeZone(Library→Exile)` fallback,
//! which has no count slot, so the exile count was dropped entirely. The new arm
//! lowers it to `Effect::ExileTop { player, count, face_down }` with the count
//! bound to the ability-defined dynamic quantity.
//!
//! These tests drive the REAL resolver (`resolve_ability_chain` /
//! `engine::game::apply`) over verbatim Oracle text, covering all four axis
//! values with a revert-probe for each. The three fixtures are:
//! owner=self × Form A ("that many") = Feldon, Ronom Excavator;
//! owner=self × Form B ("equal to <expr>") = Bone Mask;
//! owner=other × Form B' ("equal to <expr>" before the source) = Rakdos, the Muscle.
//!
//! owner=other × Form A is intentionally absent from the flipped set: every
//! Form-A "that many" card exiles "your library" = Controller; the only "their
//! library" Form-A card, Expedited Inheritance, is already `ExileTop` at base and
//! is a NO-OP, so no fixture reaches that combination.
//!
//! CR 701.13 (Exile) + CR 401.1 (library) + CR 608.2c (later text defines the
//! earlier count). CR 115.1: "target player's library" owner. CR 202.3: Rakdos's
//! "its mana value".
