//! CR 710: Kamigawa flip cards, end to end.
//!
//! Every test here builds its permanent from the card's VERBATIM Oracle text
//! and resolves the flip instruction through the real stack (`push_to_stack`
//! plus `GameAction::PassPriority` submitted through `apply()`), so the parser
//! dispatch, the `Effect` lowering, the effects dispatcher, and
//! `flip::flip_permanent` all run in production order.
//!
//! The rules-bearing assertion is CR 710.1c (`flip_keeps_color_and_mana_cost`):
//! a flip card's color and mana cost don't change when the permanent flips.
//! Reverting `flip::apply_flipped_face_to_object` to the double-faced
//! applicator (`printed_cards::apply_back_face_to_object`) blanks both and
//! fails exactly that test while every other assertion here still passes.
