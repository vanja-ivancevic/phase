//! Necrodominance — "At the beginning of your end step, you may pay any amount
//! of life. If you do, draw that many cards."
//!
//! Exercises the new `PayableResource::Life` interactive subsystem end-to-end:
//! the end-step trigger fires, the controller accepts the optional "you may",
//! commits an amount via `SubmitPayAmount`, the life-loss authority deducts that
//! many life, and the `EventContextAmount`-counted Draw rider draws that many
//! cards.
//!
//! Discriminating: starting at P0's pre-combat main, the next end step reached
//! is P0's own. The controller pays 3 life and must draw exactly 3 cards.
//! Pre-fix, "pay any amount of life" lowered to `Effect::Unimplemented`, so no
//! prompt surfaced, no life was lost, and the IfYouDo Draw read 0.
