//! CR 109.4 + CR 108.4a + CR 109.5: "your graveyard" is owner-scoped.
//!
//! **The rule.** CR 109.4: "Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have
//! a controller. Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield
//! aren't controlled by any player." None of its six exceptions covers a card in
//! a graveyard. CR 108.4a then says anything asking for such a card's controller
//! "use its owner instead", and CR 109.5 spells out the same for the word itself:
//! "you"/"your" refer to "its owner (if it has no controller)".
//!
//! So a `your graveyard` permission filter must resolve against the card's
//! OWNER. The engine already knows this — `zones.rs` cites exactly these rules
//! when it resets a departing permanent's `controller` to the owner fallback, and
//! `filter::is_owner_scoped_zone` is `Hand | Library | Graveyard`. The four
//! graveyard-permission consumers in `game::casting` were simply never routed
//! through `filter::matches_target_filter_for_zone`, the documented single
//! authority for that substitution.
//!
//! **What actually diverged.** Not the live `controller` field: `zones.rs`'s
//! `reset_for_battlefield_exit` forces `base_controller = Some(owner)` and the
//! destination-keyed reset then writes the owner back, so a graveyard card's live
//! controller is already correct. The divergence is the **LKI cache**.
//! `filter::effective_controller` reads `state.lki_cache[id].controller` for any
//! object off the battlefield/stack under `ControllerLookup::LiveOrLki`, and the
//! LKI snapshot is taken BEFORE that reset — so for a permanent that died under
//! an opponent's control it holds the THIEF.
//!
//! `matches_target_filter_in_owner_zone` passes `LiveOnly` instead, which is what
//! cures it.
//!
//! **Blast radius: the printed graveyard-permission class**, which is why this
//! suite deliberately uses a printed Ramunap-Excavator-shaped source rather than
//! any one card's parsed text. Muldrotha, Karador, Lurrus and Ramunap Excavator
//! all silently refused a card their controller owned, if an opponent happened to
//! control it when it died, for as long as the stale LKI entry survived —
//! `turns.rs` clears the LKI cache on step transition, so exposure ends at the
//! next step boundary. That cache lifetime is an engine implementation detail,
//! not a Comprehensive Rules requirement.
//!
//! The failure direction is **mis-exclusion only**: the owner's own card is
//! refused. No card is wrongly admitted by the pre-fix behaviour, so nothing
//! depended on it.
