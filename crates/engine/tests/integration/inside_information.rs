//! Inside Information (HOB) — runtime coverage for the three composed pieces:

//! > value rather than pay its mana cost.
//!
//! 1. CR 601.2b + CR 115 (targeting): X is announced as part of the cost, and
//!    the exile comes from a TARGET OPPONENT's library — not the caster's own
//!    — while the resulting `PlayFromExile` grant still binds to the ability
//!    CONTROLLER (CR 109.5), not the exiled cards' owner.
//! 2. CR 701.18b (play, not cast): "play" covers both casting a spell
//!    and playing a land, so a land among the exiled cards must be playable
//!    too, not just spells.
//! 3. CR 118.9 + CR 119.4 (alternative cost): "pay life equal to its mana
//!    value rather than pay its mana cost" REPLACES the mana cost for a spell
//!    cast this way. This reuses the `AbilityCost` alt-cost pipeline already
//!    proven by Nashi / Xander's Pact (`ExileWithAltAbilityCost` on a
//!    `CastFromZone` grant); Inside Information's grant is a plain "you may
//!    play those cards" `PlayFromExile` permission instead (it must also
//!    authorize land plays), so the alt cost folds onto a new
//!    `PlayFromExile::alt_ability_cost` field that only the spell-casting cost
//!    pipeline ever consults — land plays never reach it and stay unaffected.
