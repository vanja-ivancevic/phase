//! CR 603.3 + CR 603.3b + CR 608.2c: two wedged Mycoloth boards recover at the
//! first action boundary — turn-15 at the priority boundary that action lands
//! on, turn-20 at the entry of the boundary itself.
//!
//! Both captures show the same permanent wedge: a `PostReplacement` resolution
//! frame whose resident drain is stuck in `DrainStatus::Dispatching`. Nothing
//! can retire that entry — `begin_dispatch` refuses a `Dispatching` resident,
//! `finish_paused_dispatch` pops only a `Paused` one, and `finish_dispatch`
//! needs a transient handle that died with its dispatcher's call frame. The
//! frame therefore outlives every removal path, `resolution_stack` stays
//! non-empty forever, and `triggers::resolution_completion_can_settle` is false
//! forever. Two rules-level consequences follow, and both are visible in the
//! captures: parked triggered abilities can never be put on the stack even
//! though CR 603.3b requires them there before any player receives priority,
//! and the stale resolving carrier can never settle (CR 608.2c).

//!
//! Byte-reproducible regeneration is the recipe below **plus the U5 `deck_size`
//! migration** — `-n` is load-bearing, since without it gzip stamps an mtime and
//! the digest never lands:
//!
//! ```text
//! jq -c '{gameState}' <dump>.json | gzip -9 -n \
//!   > crates/engine/tests/integration/fixtures/mycoloth_devour_wedge_turn15.json.gz
//! ```
//!
//! Both captures predate U5, so the recipe alone is NOT sufficient: each bare
//! `"deck_size": 100` must first become the adjacently-tagged `DeckSizeRule`
//! form `{"type":"Exactly","data":100}` — the variant taken from the sibling
//! `format` field, `Commander` for both captures. Piping a raw dump straight
//! through does not merely miss the digest; it yields a fixture that
//! `PersistedGameState` cannot deserialize, and a red test on a green engine.
//! Then the retired `combat_phases_started_this_turn` /
//! `end_steps_started_this_turn` keys must be rewritten to
//! `steps_started_this_turn` (`{"BeginCombat": n, "End": m}`, zeros dropped,
//! placed at the first old key).
//!
//! # What these fixtures do and do not prove
//!
//! They are post-wedge snapshots, so they prove **recovery**, not the instant of
//! stranding. `applied: []` on both captured drains is NOT provenance about how
//! the drain was installed: `apply_pending_post_replacement_effect`
//! unconditionally `std::mem::take`s the resident's `applied` set before
//! `begin_dispatch` can decline, so under the wedge that set is emptied at every
//! priority boundary regardless of its installed contents.
//!
//! They are also *legacy* payloads — no per-frame post-replacement id, no outer
//! allocator — so they exercise none of the identity-addressed dispatch wire
//! path. That is covered by the `types/resolution.rs` round-trip rows.
//!
//! This module must NOT be read as claiming the captured strand came from the
//! Devour delivery tail. What is true is narrower: the drain *shape*
//! (`source: null`, `event_source: null`) is consistent with a
//! `clear_post_replacement_source` caller, and these captures are post-wedge
//! snapshots that prove recovery rather than the instant of stranding. The one
//! producer attribution that IS measured is the **Zur's Weirding
//! draw-replacement path**, which was observed at `BASE_SHA` to leave a
//! `Dispatching` resident both mid-scenario (`[PostReplacement, MultiDraw,
//! OptionalEffect]` under `OpponentMayChoice`) and at rest (a single-frame
//! `PostReplacement` at `Priority` — the reporter's exact wedge shape). That is
//! why this file also carries `b2_zurs_weirding_replacement_leaves_no_dispatching_drain`,
//! which is NOT a Devour scenario and says so in its own doc comment.
//!
//! # What one action does — and where
//!
//! Rows **A4** and **A4b** together discriminate the *entry* evaluation point;
//! A4's red was observed at `BASE_SHA`, before the entry call site existed.
//!
//! * **turn-15**: the pass lands on `Priority` again (`priority_passes: []`), so
//!   `resume_pending_continuation_if_priority`'s gate is true. The
//!   priority-boundary sweeper retires the frame,
//!   `settle_resolving_stack_entry_after_continuation_resume` settles the
//!   carrier, and `run_post_action_pipeline`'s deferred-trigger drain runs — all
//!   three within one `PassPriority`. Rows A1–A3.
//! * **turn-20**: the pass advances the phase, so that gate is **false** for the
//!   resulting state and the post-action sweeper is never entered. The frame is
//!   retired by the **entry** sweep in `engine::apply_action_boundary_core`,
//!   which runs on the state *as found*, before `boundary_snapshot`. The parked
//!   abilities then reach the stack in the same action — but by a seam this
//!   change does not own (`turns::process_phase_triggers`), which is gated behind
//!   `resolution_completion_can_settle` and therefore could not run at all while
//!   the strand was present. A4 records the measured terminal shape and asserts
//!   strand removal plus that drain; it pins nothing about the terminal
//!   `waiting_for`. Row A4b proves the entry siting by repairing the state on an
//!   action the engine rejects.
