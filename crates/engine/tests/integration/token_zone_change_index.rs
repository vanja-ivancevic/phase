//! CR 603.6a + CR 603.2c + CR 400.7 — a token entering the battlefield must be recorded through
//! `restrictions::record_zone_change`, so its `ZoneChanged` event carries this turn's real
//! zone-change index.
//!
//! DEFECT: `GameObject::snapshot_for_zone_change` leaves `turn_zone_change_index` at its `0`
//! placeholder for the recorder to overwrite (`zones.rs` does exactly that for ordinary moves).
//! The two token emit sites built the record and emitted it WITHOUT ever reaching the recorder, so
//! every token entry shipped index `0`. The batched zone-change replay guard
//! (`triggers.rs::batched_zone_change_already_collected`) dedups on
//! `(definition_ref, turn_zone_change_index)` — CR 603.2c, "an ability triggers only once each
//! time its trigger event occurs" — so a SECOND same-turn token batch collided with the first on
//! `(def, 0)` and its fire was silently swallowed.
//!
//! # REVERT-PROBE convention — read this before trusting an anchor
//!
//! Most assertions here carry an inline `REVERT-PROBE` anchor naming the mutation that should
//! break that assertion. **`RUN` in an anchor tag is an INSTRUCTION to you, not a claim that
//! anyone ran it.** Only anchors that also say `MEASURED` were executed, and those carry the
//! verbatim failure point (file, line, `left`/`right`). Anything else is a PREDICTION.
//!
//! This distinction is load-bearing: two anchors in this file (`PROBE X` and `PROBE Y`, on the
//! gift-token tests) named failure points their recipes never reached, and read as validated for
//! multiple review rounds precisely because nothing separated "stated" from "executed".
//!
//! The failure mode to watch for is **RECIPE SCOPE**. An *authority-wide* revert (neutering
//! `zones::record_and_emit_entry_from_no_zone` itself) also degrades the OTHER producer in the
//! same fixture — usually a priming batch the test relies on — which can trip an upstream
//! reach-guard and kill the test EARLIER than the anchor's named point. A *site-isolated* revert
//! (one emit site, primer left on the real authority) does not. Prefer site-isolated recipes.
//!
//! A discrimination claim needs BOTH mutants, and each must fail THAT assertion, not merely the
//! suite: **DROP** (delete the fix) and **TRIVIALIZE** (keep the shape, make the recorded index a
//! meaningless constant). Scope a trivialize constant to the `from: None -> Battlefield` arm — a
//! global one is dominated by the ordinary-move `TurnRecordIndexMismatch` invariant in `zones.rs`
//! and panics before any assertion here.
//!
//! **Filter trap:** `cargo test --test integration <bare_fn_name> -- --exact` runs ZERO tests and
//! exits `0`. The module path is mandatory:
//! `cargo test -p phase-engine --test integration token_zone_change_index::<fn> -- --exact`.
//! Always check the `N passed` count — a vacuous filter reports `ok. 0 passed`.
//!
//! MEASURED at this tip: `second_same_turn_token_batch_still_triggers`,
//! `mixed_group_sibling_then_token_each_fire_the_batched_trigger`,
//! `a_realized_copy_token_entry_and_a_same_turn_token_batch_take_distinct_indices` (both arms plus
//! a counter-control on its pre-fix form), the inline probe inside
//! `suppressed_liminal_copy_token_entry_is_recorded_once`, and gift-token `PROBE X` / `PROBE Y`.
//!
//! STATED BUT NOT EXECUTED here — treat as predictions until run:
//! `mixed_group_sibling_last_also_fires`,
//! `battlefield_entries_this_turn_counts_each_token_exactly_once`,
//! `conjured_battlefield_entry_after_a_token_batch_fires_the_batched_trigger`,
//! `unpaused_copy_token_entry_is_realized_by_the_copy_target_action_itself`,
//! the three `suppressed_liminal_copy_token_entry_*` realization-pause tests
//! (`..._mandatory_as_enters_choice`, `..._as_enters_choice_with_a_second_pause`,
//! `..._etb_counter_ordering_pause`), the remaining `suppressed_liminal_...` inline anchors, and
//! the `*_after_a_token_batch_fires_the_batched_trigger` family for gift, copy-token tail,
//! modification-paused copy, counter-paused token, counter-paused attached, counter-paused copy,

//
// `finalize_committed_liminal_token_entry_from_action` records AND emits inline only on the
// `TokenEntryEventEmission::Emit` route. On `Suppress` — reached solely from the liminal branch of
// `engine_replacement.rs::handle_copy_target_choice` — the token is on the battlefield before it is
// the thing that entered (`BecomeCopy` has not run), so the whole entry, record and events
// together, is PARKED on `GameState::pending_token_battlefield_entry` and realized later by
// `token::flush_pending_token_battlefield_entry`. This test pins that the realization happens
// exactly once on both per-turn ledgers, describing the copy rather than the pre-copy Shapeshifter.
//
// HONEST SCOPE — the PAUSED sub-route (a liminal entry carrying counters, so the commit consults
// `add_counter_with_replacement` and may suspend mid-loop) is NOT covered here, and is deliberately
// NOT claimed unreachable.
//
// Half of it is structural. The commit concatenates two vectors into `counters_to_apply`
// (`token.rs`): the `LiminalEntry`'s and the `ProposedEvent::TokenEntry`'s. The entry's is empty by
// construction — `token_copy.rs` takes the liminal branch only when `etb_counters.is_empty()` and
// builds the entry with `Vec::new()`.
//
// The other half is not. The event's vector also starts `Vec::new()`, but it is passed through
// `replace_event` before the commit sees it, and `apply_single_replacement` appends
// `modifiers.etb_counters` to a `TokenEntry`'s vector — which `replacement_event_keys_for_event`
// matches under BOTH `ChangeZone` and `Moved`. So a non-`SelfRef` ETB-counter replacement is not
// structurally excluded from this route.
//
// MEASURED instead of argued: driving both liminal routes (this Embalm/copy-target one and a plain
// `CopyTokenOf`) with the only two external `Moved` ETB-counter grants in `data/card-data.json`
// that admit tokens at all (Spider-Punk's and Tesak's granted Riot/Unleash — every other one is
// either `SelfRef` or `NonToken`-guarded) left `counters_to_apply` empty in every arm; on the
// copy-target route the grant is not even offered, because the token has not yet chosen what to
// copy when the replacement pass runs and both grants are subtype-scoped.
//
// So: unreached by the current card pool, not impossible. The post-finalize realization handed to
// the commit for the paused case (`PendingCounterPostAction::EmitCommittedCopyTokenEntry`,
// convergence point (b) below) is kept for that reason — it keeps the realization inside the action
// that answers the counter-ordering choice rather than resting on a `liminal_immediate ⇒ no
// counters` argument that spans two files and holds only as long as the card-pool measurement
// above does.
