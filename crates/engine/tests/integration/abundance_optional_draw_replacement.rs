//! Runtime pipeline regression for issue #516 — Abundance.
//!
//! Abundance's Oracle text: "If you would draw a card, you may instead choose
//! land or nonland and reveal cards from the top of your library until you
//! reveal a card of the chosen kind. Put that card into your hand and put all
//! other cards revealed this way on the bottom of your library in any order."
//!
//! Before the fix, the parser:
//!   1. Did not split "choose land or nonland and reveal cards ..." at the
//!      bare " and ", so the whole clause fell to `Effect::Unimplemented`.
//!   2. Did not lift "you may instead" to `ReplacementMode::Optional`, so the
//!      replacement always fired without a player prompt.
//!   3. Did not route the "of the chosen kind" filter into
//!      `Effect::RevealUntil`'s filter dispatch.
//!
//! The fix is purely parser-composition — every runtime primitive
//! (`ReplacementMode::Optional`, `Effect::Choose(CardPredicate)`,
//! `Effect::RevealUntil`, `FilterProp::MatchesLastChosenCardPredicate`,
//! player-chosen bottom placement via `RevealUntilBottomOrder` and
//! `SelectCards`) already exists.
//!
//! These tests drive the real engine pipeline through `GameAction`s:
//! prompt the draw via `DebugAction::DrawCards`, accept the optional
//! replacement, pick "Land" / "Nonland", and assert the resulting hand /
//! library composition. The +1-vs-+2 hand-size discriminator is the load-bearing
//! assertion (CR 614.6: only the accept branch replaces the event — synthesizing
//! a synthetic draw on decline would double-draw on accept).
