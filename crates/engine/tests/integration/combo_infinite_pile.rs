// engine-citation-gate: symbol anchors only
//! DESIGN STEP 4 (CR 732.2a ∞-pile display) — REAL 4-player game acceptance test.
//!
//! Loads the user's ACTUAL live 4-player Commander game state (the turn-2 dump), captured at
//! the exact `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` offer for the Witherbloom, the Balancer + Sprout Swarm
//! object-growth infinite. Drives the real APNAP accept path through `apply()` and asserts that
//! `materialize_object_growth_shortcut` snapshots the winning controller's TAPPED fodder
//! Saprolings as `GameState::unbounded_loop_pile`, that `derive_views` projects it, and that it
//! survives a serde round-trip (the user's "reloaded post-accept shows no pile" bug — now fixed
//! for POST-FIX saves).
//!
//! USER DIRECTIVE (memory: real-game fixtures, not synthetic): this fixture LOADS a real
//! 4-player complete-deck saved game-state dump and drives from it — NOT a synthetic
//! `GameScenario` (synthetic tests went green while the live 4p game failed). The dump is the
//! real game: 4 seats at 40 life, full ~91-92-card libraries, 10 permanents, the intact
//! `last_loop_action_sequence` recast context (`Recast{from_zone: Hand, uses_buyback: Used}`,
//! `convoke: Convoke`), and `loop_detection: Interactive`. The dump was captured AT the offer,
//! which is strictly more faithful than a build-fresh reconstruction (it IS the failing moment).
//! `deck_pools` (registration metadata the accept→materialize drive never reads) is trimmed from
//! the committed fixture; the real decks remain fully present as in-play library objects.
//!
//! REVERT-PROBE (documented, non-vacuous): commenting out the `register_unbounded_loop_pile`
//! call in `materialize_object_growth_shortcut` (game/engine.rs) leaves `unbounded_loop_pile`
//! empty ⇒ the positive pile assertion (1), the derived-view assertion (2), and both round-trip
//! assertions (3) all FLIP to fail. The render half (∞ vs ×N) is covered by the frontend vitest
//! (`GroupedPermanent.test.tsx`, `battlefieldGrouping.test.ts`); the MEASURED tapped count here
//! is 4, so the collapsed/staggered ∞ path is exercised, and the vitest also covers the
//! single-member branch (SHOULD-FIX #1).

// route: the same mana+life Lifedynamo loop plus one bare functioning cast trigger, so
// `cast_sourced` — the one route disjunct with no axis-shaped conjunct — carries it onto the
// replay while `batched = [Life{P0,1}]` keeps the `!batched.is_empty()` guard satisfied. Its two
// marked axes have TWO DIFFERENT termination authorities, which is the whole point:
//   * `Life(P0)` — CR 732.2c. Nothing has been gained yet, so applying the accepted
//     materialization is what ends the mark.
//   * `Mana(Colorless)` — CR 500.5 + CR 106.4. The pool is ALREADY at the infinite cap
//     (`mana_payment::refill_infinite_mana` re-tops it off this very store), so the mark is a
//     capability being exercised and the step/phase end owns its expiry.
// A wholesale `collapsed_axes` copy would let the collapse act as a second authority over a mark
// it does not own; `ResourceAxis::unbounded_mark_kind` closes that per axis.

/// **On a MIXED `{Mana, Life}` loop routed to `Replay`, the registered
/// `DriveSequence.collapsed_axes` names `Life(P0)` and NOT `Mana(_)`.** A blanket "empty
/// `collapsed_axes`" implementation passes the `Mana` half and FAILS the `Life` half; the
/// converse blanket — never filtering — is the revert probe: restore `collapsed_axes:
/// proposal.unbounded.clone()` at the `Replay` arm of `materialize_object_growth_shortcut` ⇒ the
/// exact-set assertion below reads `[Mana(Colorless), Life(P0)]` ⇒ RED.
///
/// Each reach-guard carries a reason. (a) The store really holds BOTH axes — otherwise pre- and
/// post-fix `collapsed_axes` are identical and the probe cannot flip. (b) The grafted `SpellCast`
/// def is ACTIVE (asserted in [`low3_life_engine_accepted`]'s `CastPresent` arm), attributing the
