//! THE GATE: a `WaitingFor` state with no acting player must declare what advances it.
//!
//! Read this module doc in full before changing a pin below — a pin moved without an
//! adjudicated table entry defeats the whole file. NO FIGURE THIS FILE ASSERTS IS
//! RESTATED HERE, not even to narrate why it exists: each number lives exactly once,
//! in the assertion that owns it, where an author editing it has its message in view.
//! A rustdoc restatement of an asserted figure is unanchored by construction and drifts
//! silently, which is the defect class this whole census exists to make loud.
//!
//! The gate rests on ONE structural claim: every arm of `WaitingFor::acting_authority`
//! is an UNGUARDED pattern whose body is exactly one `ActingAuthority::` constructor
//! call — possibly wrapped by `rustfmt` in a block whose single tail expression is that
//! call. `A8` (no guards), `A3a`/`A3b` (ctor-shaped bodies, path-shaped answers) and
//! `A0` (no preprocessing) are what make that claim true rather than merely hoped for.
//!
//! WHY THREE ASSERTIONS AND NOT ONE. A match GUARD is the subtle escape: guards do not
//! count towards exhaustivity, so a guarded "actorless" arm can sit above an unguarded
//! fallback, compile clean, and be silently lost. Three assertions close it, and NONE of
//! them is redundant — this was measured, and an earlier revision of this gate's design
//! got it wrong in a way that would have licensed deleting two of them:
//!
//!   * `A4b` (duplicate) catches it ONLY when the fallback arm NAMES the variant.
//!     A wildcard COVERS a variant without NAMING it, so nothing is inserted twice and
//!     `A4b` is SILENT. `A4b`'s completeness is conditional on `A1`.
//!   * `A8` (no guards) catches the guarded-arm-plus-wildcard shape that `A4b` misses.
//!   * `A1` (no wildcard / no bare binding) is the SOLE net for a GUARD-FREE arm plus a
//!     wildcard actorless fallback: `A8` is silent (no guard), `A4b` is silent (no
//!     second naming arm), and totality passes.
//!
//! Do not delete any of `A1`, `A4b`, `A8` on the grounds that another covers it.
//!
//! Two further directional dependencies, both measured: `A3b` accepts any
//! `NoActor::`-qualified PATH, so an associated const would satisfy it — `A5`, and NOT
//! `A7`, is what rejects the answer such a path records. And the `WaitingFor` / `NoActor` /
//! `ActingAuthority` enum lookups are `.expect`s rather than numbered assertions; a
//! permissive lookup would degrade into `A4a`'s `extra=[..]` side plus the declared-count
//! pin instead of failing where the cause is.
//!
//! `A11` is the only assertion here that reads the BODY of a function other than
//! `acting_authority` (`A9` reads a consumer's existence, never its body):
//! `acting_player` and `acting_players` must each be a single tail match on
//! `self.acting_authority()`. Every other body-reading assertion here reads
//! `acting_authority` while production reads the adapters, so an adapter re-forked
//! into its own match over `WaitingFor` variants is adjudicated by nothing —
//! measured on a fixture, not assumed. `A11`'s reach is the TOP-LEVEL body shape of the
//! two adapters it names: a per-variant match nested inside an arm of the delegating
//! match is not read, and a third adapter over `acting_authority` would be read by
//! nothing here.
//!
//! HOW THIS FILE FAILS. Findings are COLLECTED into a `Vec<String>` and asserted ONCE at
//! the end; only the preconditions (parse, enum lookups, `A10`, `A0`) and the `ACTORLESS`
//! cardinality reach-guard panic immediately. That is deliberate and load-bearing, not a
//! style choice: the shapes this gate catches are diagnosed by the COMBINATION of reds —
//! a guarded actorless arm reds `A8`, `A4b` and `A5` together, and under a fail-fast
//! reading only the first is ever seen, which would make `A4b` look silent on the one
//! fixture that proves it is not. Do not convert these back into individual `assert!`s.
//!
//! Findings are emitted in a stable order on three nested levels: every per-arm finding
//! precedes every whole-census finding; arms are walked in source order; and within one
//! arm the steps run pattern extraction (`A1`/`A2`) first, then the guard check (`A8`),
//! then body classification (`A3a`/`A3b`), then the duplicate check (`A4b`). An
//! implementation that emits `A8` before `A1` for a single guarded wildcard arm is
//! wrong, not merely differently formatted.
//!
//! Pattern follows `loop_shortcut.rs`'s `syn` census: parse the source rather than
//! grep it, so comments and strings cannot be mistaken for code.
