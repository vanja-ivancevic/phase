//! Issue #7386 coverage: The Ozolith's beginning-of-combat counter move.
//!
//! "At the beginning of combat on your turn, if The Ozolith has counters on it,
//! you may move all counters from The Ozolith onto target creature."
//!
//! SHAPE UNDER TEST. `MoveCounters { source: SelfRef, mode: Move, selection:
//! StackTarget, target: Typed{Creature} }`, driven by a `Phase` trigger, with
//! `counter_type: null` / `count: null` ("all counters, every kind").
//! `selection: StackTarget` is the discriminant routing `resolve_move` into the
//! single-destination branch rather than the two "any number" distribution
//! branches; before this file that branch had no end-to-end coverage at all
//! (the nearest test, issue_680_shalai_upkeep_move.rs, drives
//! `ResolutionDistributionAnyNumber`).
//!
//! DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED HERE. Other points on the `StackTarget` grid remain
//! uncovered: the `count: Some(n)` transfer-limit branch and the
//! `counter_type: Some(kind)` narrowing used by the activated siblings
//! (Weapon Rack, Afiya Grove, Costume Closet, Simic Fluxmage, Diamond City).
//! This file scopes to the trigger-driven "all counters" instance that #7386
//! reports; the limit/narrowing axes are follow-up work, not covered by a claim
//! made here.
//!
//! STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING REPORT. Issue #7386 reports that the trigger fired,
//! a creature was chosen, the trigger resolved, and no counters moved. That
//! narrative is the reporter's; it is NOT engine-confirmed. The verbatim
//! reported scenario passes on unmodified `origin/main`, and no save or replay
//! of the reporting game exists, so the root cause is UNPINNED. These tests
//! close the coverage gap above and pin the four distinct paths that all
//! produce the reporter's user-visible symptom (counters stay put):
//!
//!   1. the declared target is illegal at resolution      (CR 608.2b)
//!   2. the intervening-if is false at resolution          (CR 603.4)
//!   3. no legal target exists at put-on-stack time        (CR 603.3d)
//!   4. the "you may" window is declined or unanswered     (CR 608.2d)
//!
//! Paths 1-3 emit no prompt at all, matching the report's most diagnostic
//! detail (no "you may" prompt was shown).
//!
//! A successful move IS distinguishable in the event stream: it commits through
//! `apply_counter_move_commit` (game/effects/counters.rs), which emits
//! `GameEvent::CounterRemoved` then `GameEvent::CounterAdded`. Every one of the
//! four no-op paths returns before those counter events. These tests use prompt
//! observations to distinguish the user-visible paths; they do not assert that
//! their full event streams are identical. In particular, no legal target drops
//! the trigger before it reaches the stack, while a failed intervening-if is
//! handled during stack resolution. That is why the reporting game could not be
//! diagnosed after the fact.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 122.5: If an effect says to move a counter, it's removed from the
//!     first object and put on the second object. If either action isn't
//!     possible, no counter is removed from or put onto anything.
//!   - CR 603.3d: A triggered ability that requires targets is put on the stack
//!     only if legal targets are available; otherwise it's removed.
//!   - CR 603.4: An intervening-if clause is checked on trigger and again on
//!     resolution; if false at resolution the ability is removed from the stack.
//!   - CR 608.2b: If all of a spell or ability's targets are illegal on
//!     resolution, it doesn't resolve and is removed from the stack.
//!   - CR 608.2d: Choices offered by a resolving effect are announced as the
//!     effect is applied; a player can't choose an impossible option.
