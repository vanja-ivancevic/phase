//! Issue #6691 — CR 110.2a: a battlefield-destination zone change that states
//! `"under their control"` must put the permanent under the named player's
//! control, not under the resolving player's.
//!
//! CR 110.2a: "If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the
//! battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player's control
//! **unless the effect states otherwise**." Jailbreak states otherwise: it
//! returns a permanent card from an OPPONENT's graveyard "under their control".
//!
//! CR 400.1 + CR 400.3 + CR 404.1: a card in a graveyard is in ITS OWNER's
//! graveyard, so "an opponent's graveyard" identifies that opponent as the
//! card's owner (CR 108.3). The parser therefore binds the anaphor to
//! `ControllerRef::ParentTargetOwner`.
//!
//! SCOPE OF THIS TEST — read before trusting it as a regression guard.
//!
//! This test does NOT discriminate the fix at the runtime layer, and that was
//! measured, not assumed: with `enters_under` stripped from the fixture entry
//! (i.e. the pre-fix AST) this test still passes. On a graveyard → battlefield
//! move the engine already resolves the new object's controller to its OWNER,
//! and for Jailbreak the owner IS the player the clause names, so the correct
//! binding and the unfixed default coincide. Staging the graveyard card with a
//! divergent controller does not separate them either — the zone move
//! reassigns it.
//!
//! What this test therefore is: a runtime REACH + NON-REGRESSION guard. It
//! proves the bound `ControllerRef::ParentTargetOwner` resolves cleanly through
//! `resolve_enters_under_player` (rather than raising `InvalidParam`, which is
//! exactly what a wrong binding such as `Opponent` or `TargetPlayer` would do
//! here), and that the card still resolves end-to-end.
//!
//! The DISCRIMINATING test for this change is the parser-level assertion in
//! `oracle_effect/tests.rs::jailbreak_enters_under_their_control_binds_to_the_owner`,
//! which asserts `enters_under == Some(ParentTargetOwner)` and fails with the
//! fix reverted (the clause is dropped and the field is `None`). The
//! fixture-integrity guard below is also revert-sensitive.
//!
//! HOSTILE FIXTURE: a THREE-player game where the victim is owned by P1 and P2
//! also holds a graveyard permanent. A two-player game cannot discriminate
//! `ParentTargetOwner` from several wrong bindings (seat-order fallbacks, "the
//! only opponent"), so the third seat is load-bearing.
