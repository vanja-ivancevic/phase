//! Regression for the #6956 fix round: a co-anchored "where X is …" clause
//! group must not have its shared X redefined by a middle clause that produced
//! zero.
//!
//! Oracle (Thorna and Twigtooth; the fixture omits the unmodelled topmost-card
//! perpetual conjunct, see THORNA_ORACLE):
//!   "Thorna and Twigtooth enters with two -1/-1 counters on it.
//!    Whenever Thorna and Twigtooth attacks, remove all counters from target
//!    creature you control. Each opponent loses X life and you gain X life,
//!    where X is the number of counters removed this way."
//!
//! The trigger lowers to a chain-relative
//! `RemoveCounter -> LoseLife{PreviousEffectAmount} -> GainLife{PreviousEffectAmount}`,
//! so every clause reads whatever the immediately preceding step left in
//! `last_effect_amount` rather than the anchored X.
//!
//! #6956's first pass made a genuine zero overwrite that slot. That is right for
//! a fresh producer, but the middle `LoseLife` here is a RELAY — its own amount
//! IS the shared X. With an opponent under CR 119.8 "can't lose life" the relay
//! totals zero, and claiming that zero made the gain clause read 0 instead of
//! the counters removed. The card was accidentally correct before #6956 (via
//! exactly the leak #6956 closed) and would have been silently wrong after.
//!
//! CR references:
//!   - CR 608.2c: the controller follows the instructions in the order written;
//!     "…X…, …X…, and …X…, where X is <definition>" names ONE value that every
//!     clause reads.
//!   - CR 119.8: "If an effect says that a player can't lose life, …" — Platinum
//!     Emperion's "Your life total can't change" blocks the middle clause.
//!   - CR 122.1: a counter is a marker placed on an object; X is the number of
//!     counters actually removed.
