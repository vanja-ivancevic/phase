//! Issue #3272 — Lightstall Inquisitor. The ETB compound "each opponent exiles
//! a card from their hand and may play that card for as long as it remains
//! exiled" must split into a player-scoped exile plus an owner-binding
//! `PlayFromExile` grant, and the two rider sentences ("Each spell cast this way
//! costs {1} more to cast." / "Each land played this way enters tapped.") must
//! fold into that grant's `cast_cost_modifier` / `land_enter_tapped` rather than
//! emitting a board-wide cost static or ETB-tapped replacement.
