//! Integration test for issue #2943 — Kaya's Wrath lifegain from destroyed creatures.
//!
//! Oracle:
//!   "Destroy all creatures. You gain life equal to the number of creatures
//!    you controlled that were destroyed this way."
//!
//! Before the fix the lifegain clause lowered to `Effect::Unimplemented` because
//! `parse_quantity_ref` let `parse_type_phrase_folding` consume "creatures you controlled"
//! and leave an unresolved "that were destroyed this way" tail. The fix routes
//! "the number of … destroyed/sacrificed this way" through
//! `FilteredTrackedSetSize` before the generic object-count fall-through.
//!
//! CR 701.8a: Destroy moves battlefield permanents to the graveyard.
//! CR 608.2c + CR 400.7: Downstream sub-abilities count only objects actually
//!   moved by the preceding destroy, optionally filtered by controller/type.
//! CR 119.3: Gain life equal to that filtered count.
