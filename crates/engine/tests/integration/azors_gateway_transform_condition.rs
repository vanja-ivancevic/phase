//! Issue #6004: Azor's Gateway — "{1}, {T}: Draw a card, then exile a card
//! from your hand. If cards with five or more different mana values are
//! exiled with Azor's Gateway, you gain 5 life, untap Azor's Gateway, and
//! transform it."
//!
//! `oracle_tests.rs::azors_gateway_transform_condition_parses_with_zero_swallowed_clauses`
//! and the `condition.rs` unit tests already prove the PARSE shape (the
//! `ObjectCountDistinct[ManaValue](ExiledBySource) >= 5` condition gates all
//! three effects). This file proves the RUNTIME behavior end to end: the real
//! `ActivateAbility` pipeline draws, exiles via an interactive
//! `EffectZoneChoice`, and the engine's `should_track_exiled_by_source` scan
//! (CR 607.2a) links the exiled card to Azor's Gateway automatically — no
//! manual `ExileLink` wiring for the LIVE activation.
//!
//! Both tests pre-seed N-1 prior exiles as synthetic `TrackedBySource` links
//! (mirroring `mechtitan_core_return_exiled.rs`) so a single live activation
//! exercises the boundary crossing rather than five real taps. Each test also
//! sets Azor's Gateway's `back_face`, even in the below-threshold case, so
//! "did not transform" is never proven vacuously (CR 701.27a requires a
//! `back_face` for `Effect::Transform` to be anything but a no-op).
//!
//! Discriminator: reverting the parser fix (PR #6119) drops the whole `If`
//! clause, leaving an UNCONDITIONAL `GainLife` and no `Untap`/`Transform` sub-
//! abilities at all — every assertion in
//! `azors_gateway_below_threshold_does_not_transform` flips (life gained,
//! stays tapped either way) and `azors_gateway_at_threshold_transforms`'s
//! untap/transform assertions fail outright.
