//! CR 113.7 defines an ability's source; these inherent triggered abilities have
//! no source object by their own rules.
//!
//! CR 725.2 (monarch), CR 726.2 (initiative), CR 728.1 (rad counters) and
//! CR 702.179d (speed) each say so in the same words — "these triggered
//! abilities have no source". CR 113.8 instead defines an ability's controller;
//! CR 901.8 separately gives Planechase's planeswalking ability no source. The
//! engine models these four constructed triggers with `ObjectId(0)`, which
//! resolves to no `GameObject`.
//!
//! The consequence is a display hole, not a rules hole: `StackEntryKind::
//! TriggeredAbility::source_name` is filled by looking `source_id` up in the
//! objects map, so these four entries reach the client with an EMPTY name. The
//! client has nothing to render and substitutes a name of its own — which is the
//! display layer deriving game-facing content, the one thing it must never do.
//!
//! Reported from a real game: increasing speed off combat damage briefly showed a
//! blank card on the stack.
//!
//! These rows assert the wire contract the client depends on: a stack entry
//! always carries a name for its own source, whether or not that source is an
//! object.
