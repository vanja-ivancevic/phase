//! Regression: "remove all of them and transform it" (level-up / incubate class).
//!
//! CR 122.1 + CR 608.2k + CR 603.4 + CR 701.27: the trigger
//! "When ~ has N or more <type> counters on it, [if ...,] remove all of them
//! and transform it" must parse the anaphoric "remove all of them" / "remove
//! them" clause into `Effect::RemoveCounter` (remove-all sentinel) chained to
//! `Effect::Transform`. Previously the imperative dispatch gate required the
//! literal word "counter" in the clause, so the bare-pronoun anaphor dropped to
//! `Effect::Unimplemented`. Covers Ludevic's Test Subject, Smoldering Egg, and
//! the level-up/incubate class generally.
