//! CR 115.7 — a parked retarget prompt must always be answerable.
//!
//! Three propositions, all reached through production entry points:
//!
//! 1. the retarget pool comes from the stack entry's OWN targeting authority,
//!    not from an Aura host's enchant filter (an Aura's triggered ability is a
//!    different object on the stack than the Aura spell — CR 115.1b + CR 113.7a,
//!    against the Aura SPELL's own rule, CR 303.4a);
//! 2. an empty pool resolves as a CR 115.7a no-change instead of parking a
//!    prompt nothing can discharge;
//! 3. every submission the AI proposes for a parked prompt is accepted by the
//!    reducer, because both consult the same per-slot authority
//!    (`retarget_slot_violation`).

/// two oracle templates (`try_parse_change_targets`,
/// parser/oracle_effect/mod.rs), so a correctness fix must DISPATCH ON THE

///   - "change a target of " → CR 115.7b: "the process described in rule 115.7a
///     is followed, except that only one of those targets may be changed (rather
///     than all of them or none of them)". This fixture's per-address write
///     already matches this remedy exactly: one slot changes, the other stays
///     in place, untouched.
///   - "change the target of " → CR 115.7a, which ends: "If all the targets
///     aren't changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed." Remedy
///     for a multi-target entry: ALL-OR-NONE — changing only slot 0 while slot 1
///     stays as it was is WRONG under this subrule, even though nothing is lost
///     or corrupted. This is Bolt Bend's wording — the WORDING only. Bolt Bend
///     itself reads "with a single target", and of the 22 printed cards matching
///     `o:"change the target of"`, the six omitting that literal phrase each
///     restrict to one target by the equivalent "targets ONLY <x>" / "a single
///     <x>" construction. No printed card on this template can therefore present
///     a multi-target entry, which is why the fixture below is synthetic.
///
/// So the length-1 acceptance below is CR-115.7b-correct for THIS fixture and
/// only a concern under the unreachable-by-printed-card CR-115.7a template.
/// Recorded here as OBSERVED CURRENT BEHAVIOUR rather than a blanket
/// endorsement, because `RetargetScope::Single` itself cannot tell the two
/// templates apart at this seam:
///
///   DEFERRED(out-of-run): interactive Single-scope retarget cannot honor CR
///   115.7a's all-or-none remedy for a synthetic multi-target entry reached
///   through the "change the target of" template — upstream cause filter.rs
///   FilterProp::HasSingleTarget is permissive with no resolution-time
///   validation; fix needs filter.rs + interaction.rs, both outside phase 1's
///   frozen scope.
///
/// The honest behavioural delta this phase knowingly takes: at BASE the AI froze
/// on this class — the generator's sole proposal was rejected, so no actor could
/// discharge the prompt. AFTER this change it PROGRESSES with a per-address,
/// single-slot write that does not truncate or corrupt the target list; it is
/// simply not a claim of CR-115.7a correctness for a synthetic "change the
/// target of" entry. A genuinely CR-115.7a-correct submission for that template
/// is not expressible against today's reducer contract at all, which is why the
/// deferral above names two paths outside this run's frozen scope rather than a
/// local repair.
///
/// UPDATED (phase-rs/phase#8355, round 8): under Invariant SC a production
/// `Single`-scope prompt is no longer built with an empty `slot_pools` — every
/// exposed position, under EVERY scope, gets its pool from the one computation
