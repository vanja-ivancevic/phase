//! Integration tests for curse cards with upkeep triggers.
//!
//! Covers 9 curses that trigger "At the beginning of enchanted player's upkeep":
//!   - Curse of the Pierced Heart (deals 1 damage)
//!   - Curse of Thirst (deals damage equal to number of Curses attached)
//!   - Curse of the Bloody Tome (mill two cards)
//!   - Curse of Oblivion (exile two cards from graveyard)
//!   - Curse of Surveillance (target players other than the enchanted player
//!     each draw cards equal to the number of Curses attached to them)
//!   - Curse of Misfortunes (search library for a Curse)
//!   - Curse of Unbinding (exile from hand, may cast)
//!   - Cruel Reality (sacrifice creature/planeswalker or lose 5 life)
//!   - Torment of Scarabs (lose 3 unless sacrifice/discard)
//!
//! Each test verifies at minimum that the upkeep trigger fires (stack count
//! assertion). For simpler cards, the resolved effect is also verified.
//!
//! CR references:
//!   - CR 303.4b: An Aura that enchants a player is attached to that player.
//!   - CR 503.1: The upkeep step begins with upkeep triggers going on the stack.

// yet, so the parser fails closed instead of fabricating a wrong filter --
// the Draw ability lowers to `Effect::Unimplemented` (see
