//! CR 508.1c beats CR 508.1d, on the DEFENDER-ANCHORED half — plus the three
//! per-pairing axes `defending_player_controls_combat_anchor.rs` leaves
//! unreached.
//!
//! A `CantAttack` gated on `StaticCondition::DefendingPlayerControls` cannot be
//! answered by a CREATURE-LEVEL query: CR 506.2 + CR 508.5 determine the
//! defending player relative to an attacking creature and the target it is
//! declared against, and a "can this creature attack at all?" question carries
//! neither. `static_abilities::static_ability_match_applies` therefore DEFERS
//! such a static to the per-pairing authority `combat::attacker_can_attack_target`,
//! which does carry a target. That deferral is correct — but it also makes
//! `combat::creature_cant_attack_gated` answer `false` for every defender-gated
//! creature, and that bool was the whole CR 508.1d "if able" gate inside
//! `creature_must_attack_with_attackable_targets_gated`. Requirement/display and
//! legality were therefore two predicates that could disagree; they now share one
//! pairability authority (`combat::legal_attack_targets_iter`), whose LIST view
//! (`legal_attack_targets_for_attacker`) is the payload's per-attacker map and
//! whose short-circuiting EXISTENTIAL view
//! (`attacker_has_legal_attack_target`) is the "if able" gate.
//!
//! ROW 1 (`goaded_defender_gated_creature_badge_agrees_with_enforcement`) is the
//! regression pin for the resulting display/enforcement split. ROWS 2-4 are
//! additive coverage that already held before it:
//!   * ROW 2 — CR 508.5a: the defending player is individually determined for
//!     each attacking creature (3-player; main's anchor file is entirely
//!     two-player, where CR 506.2 fixes one defending player for the phase).
//!   * ROW 3 — CR 508.5a again, from the other side: ONE static definition, two
//!     recipients attacking two different defenders in the SAME combat, with
//!     opposite verdicts. Proves the anchor binds per RECIPIENT, not per carrier.
//!   * ROW 4 — a REMOTE carrier (`affected != SelfRef`) across its zone of
//!     function (CR 113.6b) and CR 702.26b phasing.
//!
//! Fixture discipline, inherited from `defending_player_controls_combat_anchor.rs`:
//! a SUCCESSFUL `declare_attackers` advances past the step, so every positive
//! control that succeeds runs on a CLONE, or runs last. A REJECTED declaration
//! leaves the step open and may be followed by another.
