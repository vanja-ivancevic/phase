//! Standard long-tail batch D — parser/static seams that route to EXISTING
//! engine surface, no new engine variant (the `add-engine-variant` gate verdict
//! was "parameterize, don't proliferate" for every change here).
//!
//! SHIPPED (0-Unimplemented + discriminating runtime/derived assertion that
//! flips on revert):
//!   - Laughing Jasper Flint — "Creatures you control but don't own are
//!     Mercenaries in addition to their other types" (LT-F type-grant; its
//!     upkeep cast line is an honest gap, see its test). Two
//!     parser arms: a generic consonant+y → "-ies" plural rule in `parse_subtype`
//!     ("Mercenaries" → "Mercenary"), and a "<creatures you control> but don't
//!     own" negated-ownership qualifier in the static dispatch arm.
//!   - Midnight Mangler — "During turns other than yours, ~ is an artifact
//!     creature" (LT-F type-grant). Extended the leading turn-restriction peel in
//!     `parse_pronoun_becomes_type_static` to the negated `Not(DuringYourTurn)`
//!     direction.
//!   - Tapestry Warden — "Each creature you control with toughness greater than
//!     its power stations permanents using its toughness rather than its power"
//!     (LT-C station-contribution). Added the bare "stations permanents" leaf to
//!     the existing crew/saddle/station contribution action list.
//!   - Rocket-Powered Goblin Glider — "if it was cast from your graveyard"
//!     (LT-C gravecast). Added the bare "(was|were) cast from [a|your] graveyard"
//!     intervening-if arm → `TriggerCondition::WasCast { zone: Graveyard,
//!     controller: None, owner: Some(You) }`. CR 400.3 + CR 404.1: a graveyard is
//!     owner-specific, so "your graveyard" scopes the origin-zone OWNER, not the
//!     caster — an opponent casting your card from your graveyard satisfies it.
//!     The owner-vs-caster runtime discrimination (all four owner × caster rows)
//!     is asserted in-crate in `game::triggers` against the real
//!     `check_trigger_condition` seam, which is `pub(crate)` and unreachable here.
//!   - Nowhere to Run — "Creatures your opponents control can be the targets of
//!     spells and abilities as though they didn't have hexproof. Ward abilities of
//!     those creatures don't trigger." One static line → an object-scoped
//!     `IgnoreHexproof` (CR 702.11b/702.11e) plus a `SuppressTriggers`
//!     `{BecomesTargeted}` over the same "those creatures" subject (CR 702.21a +
//!     CR 611.3 + CR 613.11). The multiplayer bypass scope and ward-suppression
//!     runtime discriminators live in-crate in `game::targeting` / `game::triggers`
//!     (`pub(crate)`, unreachable here); this crate asserts the end-to-end
//!     zero-Unimplemented parse and the two emitted statics.
//!
//! BUILDING BLOCK (general arm, not card-specific): a count-leading
//! "look at/reveal <count> cards from the top of <owner>'s library" dig
//! word-order. Supported for FIXED counts in both the private (look) and public
//! (reveal) directions and resolves correctly. NON-fixed counts are refused (a
//! coverage-honesty guard): the reveal direction is demoted to a `u32`-count
//! `RevealTop`, and a variable look pairs with a `Put X` keep-count that
//! `Effect::Dig.keep_count: Option<u32>` cannot represent, so a dynamic count
//! would over-claim support while behaving wrong at runtime.
//!
//! DEFERRED (honesty guards assert the residual is exactly the unsupported
//! clause, not an over-claim): Sandman (compound self+target return to
//! battlefield), Fblthp (plot-from-top infra), Choreographed Sparks (the
//! `CopySpell` resolver does not apply `AddKeyword`/`GrantTrigger` modifications
//! to the copy), Leyline of Transformation (continuous type-grant on
//! non-battlefield zones), Stargaze (variable dig look/keep count needs
//! `Dig.count`/`keep_count` as `QuantityExpr` end-to-end).
