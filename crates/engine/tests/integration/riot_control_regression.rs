//! Regression for issue #308: Riot Control was reported as gaining life but
//! not preventing damage.
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!     "You gain 1 life for each creature your opponents control.
//!      Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you this turn."
//!
//! Investigation showed both the parser (`GainLife → sub_ability: PreventDamage`
//! is emitted in card-data.json) and the runtime chain resolver are correct.
//! This integration test pins the end-to-end behavior so a future regression
//! in either layer (parser dropping the second sentence, or the chain
//! resolver short-circuiting before the prevention sub_ability runs) is
//! caught here rather than rediscovered as a user-facing bug.
//!
//! CR 615:    Prevention shields modify damage events through the replacement
//!            pipeline.
//! CR 119.1:  Gain life increases the player's life total.
