//! GitHub issue #1514 — Dark Depths + Thespian's Stage combo doesn't work.
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   Dark Depths: "Dark Depths enters with ten ice counters on it.
//!     {3}: Remove an ice counter from Dark Depths.
//!     When Dark Depths has no ice counters on it, sacrifice it. If you do,
//!     create Marit Lage, a legendary 20/20 black Avatar creature token with
//!     flying and indestructible."
//!   Thespian's Stage: "{T}: Add {C}.
//!     {2}, {T}: This land becomes a copy of target land, except it has this
//!     ability."
//!
//! The classic combo: P0 controls Dark Depths (10 ice counters) and Thespian's
//! Stage. Activate Stage's BecomeCopy targeting Depths. After resolution the
//! Stage's intrinsic copiable values are now Dark Depths' — including the
//! "has no ice counters" state-trigger — but per CR 707.10 / CR 122.1c the
//! copy has zero counters (a copy does not inherit counters; the
//! "enters with ten ice counters" replacement only applies on enter, and the
//! Stage doesn't re-enter). So the copy's state trigger immediately fires.
//!
//! What the reporter observed: no Marit Lage token appeared. This test drives
//! the real pipeline (activate → BecomeCopy resolve → state trigger scan →
//! resolve sacrifice + Marit Lage creation) and asserts the combo works
//! end-to-end.
//!
//! CR references (verified against `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`):
//!   - CR 614.1c: a permanent enters with no counters except as the result of
//!     a replacement / sub-effect specifying otherwise.
//!   - CR 122.1: counter handling.
//!   - CR 603.8: state triggers re-evaluate after each SBA cycle.
//!   - CR 707.2: a copy effect copies the source's copiable values.
//!   - CR 707.10: counters on the original are not part of copiable values.
