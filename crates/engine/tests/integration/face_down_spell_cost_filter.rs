//! CR 601.2f + CR 708.4: a cost-modifier static filtered on "face-down creature
//! spells" must reduce the {3} a morph/megamorph/disguise card pays to be cast
//! face down (CR 702.37c / CR 702.168b).
//!
//! Class (measured against `card-data.json`, 3 cards): Kadena, Slinking Sorcerer
//! ("The first face-down creature spell you cast each turn costs {3} less to
//! cast"), Dream Chisel and Obscuring Aether ("Face-down creature spells you
//! cast cost {1} less to cast"). All three parse into a `StaticMode::ModifyCost`
//! whose `spell_filter` carries `FilterProp::FaceDown`.
//!
//! Before the fix that filter could never match: the live cost seam projects the
//! spell into a `SpellCastRecord`, and `FilterProp::FaceDown` failed closed
//! against that record — grouped with battlefield-only predicates, although
//! CR 708.4 puts a face-down spell on the stack as a real spell. The reduction
//! was therefore dead for every card in the class.
//!
//! These tests drive the real cast pipeline (`GameAction::CastSpell` →
//! `continue_cast_face_down` → cost calculation → mana payment) and read the
//! mana left unspent, so they measure what a player pays.
