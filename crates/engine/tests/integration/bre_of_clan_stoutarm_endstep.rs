//! Bre of Clan Stoutarm — end-step "impulse a nonland card, cast it only if it
//! is cheap enough, otherwise put it into your hand" trigger.
//!
//! Oracle (relevant ability):
//!   At the beginning of your end step, if you gained life this turn, exile
//!   cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card. You may
//!   cast that card without paying its mana cost if the spell's mana value is
//!   less than or equal to the amount of life you gained this turn. Otherwise,
//!   put it into your hand.
//!
//! These tests drive the REAL parser (`add_creature_from_oracle`) and the REAL
//! trigger→resolution pipeline (scenario runner). The composition under test is
//! `ExileFromTopUntil { NextMatches(nonland) }` with a `CastFromZone`
//! sub-ability gated by `condition = ObjectManaValue{Target} <=
//! LifeGainedThisTurn{Controller}` and `else_ability = ChangeZone -> Hand`.
//!
//! Revert map (the parser gate this PR adds re-homes the trailing
//! "if the spell's mana value is less than or equal to ..." condition onto the
//! cast clause, which in turn routes "Otherwise" to `else_ability`). Reverting
//! the condition combinator drops the gate: the cast becomes an unconditional
//! sub-ability whose "Otherwise" degrades to a `SequentialSibling`
//! `ChangeZone -> Hand` that always fires, so every impulse hit ends in hand
//! regardless of mana value and is never offered for a free cast.
//!   * `free_cast_when_mana_value_within_life_gained` — REVERT-FAILING. With
//!     the gate, mana value <= life gained presents an `OptionalEffectChoice`
//!     offer and accepting casts the card (it reaches the stack). Reverted,
//!     the card is swept to hand with no offer, so the "exiled before the
//!     offer" and "on the stack after accept" assertions both flip.
//!   * `else_to_hand_when_mana_value_exceeds_life_gained` — companion. Asserts
//!     the mana value > life gained branch puts the card in hand with no cast
//!     offer. End-state alone does not discriminate (the reverted unconditional
//!     path also lands the card in hand); the discrimination for the gate is
//!     carried by `free_cast_*`.
//!
//!   * `decline_eligible_cast_goes_to_hand` — CHARACTERIZATION test (not a
//!     rules-confirmed assertion): pins the current behavior where declining an
//!     eligible (mana value <= life gained) free cast puts the card into HAND.
//!
//! NOTE (Otherwise-routing): the engine fires the parsed `else_ability` on BOTH
//! the condition-false branch (mana value > life) AND the optional-decline
//! branch — the pre-existing else_ability convention (Wick/Chandra "may X,
//! otherwise Y"). So decline-while-eligible -> hand is the deliberate current
//! convention. It is NOT confirmed correct: the strict editorial reading of
//! "Otherwise" (= condition-negation only) implies a declined-but-eligible card
//! would stay exiled, and there is no published Bre ruling either way (as of
//! 2026-07-02). Splitting the two outcomes is class-wide engine debt.
