//! CR 116.2b + CR 702.37e: the turn-face-up special action must be OFFERED, not
//! merely accepted (#6732, #4381).
//!
//! The engine implemented the action and its Priority preflight counted it as
//! progress, but `ai_support::candidates::priority_actions_with_probe` — the
//! list the client renders — never emitted it. Nothing could send an action the
//! engine never advertised, so the whole morph / megamorph / disguise / manifest
//! / cloak class was unturnable in play. #7342 wired the client's dispatch and
//! closed both reports; its test supplies the action to itself, so it proves the
//! client's half and cannot observe the engine's.
//!
//! Reported from a real game state: the controller had priority, a face-down
//! Coral Trickster (morph `{U}`) and thirty untapped Islands, and `legalActions`
//! held six casts, four land plays and a pass.
