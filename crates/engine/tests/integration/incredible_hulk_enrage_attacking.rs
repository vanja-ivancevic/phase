//! The Incredible Hulk (MSH) — Enrage's "If he's attacking," rider must GATE
//! the additional-combat-phase (and untap) sub-effects while leaving the +1/+1
//! counter ungated.
//!
//! Oracle: "Reach, trample\nEnrage — Whenever The Incredible Hulk is dealt
//! damage, put a +1/+1 counter on him. If he's attacking, untap him and there
//! is an additional combat phase after this phase."
//!
//! The recognizer already yields `StaticCondition::SourceIsAttacking` for "he's
//! attacking"; the fix bridges it to `AbilityCondition::SourceMatchesFilter {
//! Typed([Attacking]) }` in `static_condition_to_ability_condition` so the
//! parsed sub-ability carries the gate. CR 608.2c: instructions resolve in
//! written order and the rider modifies the later sub-effects only. CR 207.2c:
//! Enrage is an ability word (no rules meaning) — the line is a plain
//! `DamageReceived` trigger.
//!
//! Discriminating observable: the **additional combat phase** (`state.extra_phases`)
//! is scheduled iff Hulk is attacking. The ONLY variable between the two tests is
//! whether Hulk is in `state.combat.attackers`; the damage source is held constant
//! (direct `Effect::DealDamage` to Hulk). Reverting the bridge (the arm back to
//! `=> None`) drops the condition, so the gated chain fires unconditionally and
//! Test B's `extra_phases.is_empty()` assertion flips to red.
//!
//! The chained "untap him" (`SetTapState { target: ParentTarget }`) was a
//! pre-existing no-op for this card — the head `PutCounter` targets `SelfRef`,
//! which is not materialized into `ability.targets` (issue #323), so the chained
//! `ParentTarget` inherited no object to untap. That targeting-path gap (distinct
//! from this condition-bridge fix) is now closed at parse time:
//! `sequence::patch_self_ref_head_tap_anaphor` rewrites the chained
//! single-permanent `SetTapState`'s `ParentTarget` to `SelfRef` whenever the
//! antecedent head's subject is `SelfRef`, so the untap binds the source via
//! `tap_untap_target_ids`' `SelfRef` arm. A head with a real or optional target
//! (Tyvar Kell "...up to one target Elf. Untap it.") keeps `ParentTarget`, so a
//! declined optional target correctly no-ops (CR 608.2b — the anaphor has no
//! referent). `enrage_untaps_hulk_when_attacking` (Test C) exercises Hulk's untap
//! directly; the condition-bridge tests (A/B) keep their independent observable on
//! the additional-combat-phase (`state.extra_phases`), which the gate *does*
//! control, so the gate discriminator stays revert-proven.
