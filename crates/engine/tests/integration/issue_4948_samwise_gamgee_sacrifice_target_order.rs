//! Issue #4948 — Samwise Gamgee's "Sacrifice three Foods: Return target
//! historic card from your graveyard to your hand" could offer one of the
//! just-sacrificed Food tokens as its OWN target. This engine pays a
//! non-self sacrifice activation cost BEFORE choosing the ability's target
//! (a documented CR 601.2c-vs-601.2h/602.2b ordering shortcut — see issue
//! #1301's `exclude_cost_paid_object_that_left_battlefield`), reversed from
//! CR 602.2b's real "choose targets, THEN pay costs" order. A sacrificed
//! Food is itself Historic (it's an artifact) and lands in the graveyard the
//! instant the cost is paid, so — before this fix — it transiently
//! qualified as a legal "target historic card from your graveyard" candidate
//! for the very same activation. CR 704.5d then makes the token cease to
//! exist before the ability resolves, so if it was chosen the ability
//! silently fizzled (CR 608.2b): "targeted Object N, then did nothing when
//! it resolved" — the exact reported symptom. See the maintainer's own
//! root-cause analysis on the issue (`mike-theDude`, 2026-07-10) confirming
//! the cost-before-target ordering risk.
//!
//! Root cause of the leak: `exclude_cost_paid_object_that_left_battlefield`
//! (`game/ability_utils.rs`) already existed for exactly this problem class
//! (issue #1301, Cauldron of Essence), but only tracked a SINGLE cost-paid
//! object (`ResolvedAbility.cost_paid_object`, stamped from `chosen.first()`
//! at each non-self Sacrifice/Discard/Exile cost-payment site). Samwise
//! sacrifices THREE Foods, so only one of the three was ever excluded — the
//! other two remained legal. The fix generalizes this to a
//! `Vec<CostPaidObjectSnapshot>` (`cost_paid_objects`, via
//! `ResolvedAbility::add_cost_paid_objects_recursive`), populated
//! alongside the existing singular stamp at all three non-self cost-payment
//! sites (`handle_sacrifice_for_cost`, `handle_discard_for_cost`,
//! `finish_exile_selection_for_cost`), so the ONE shared exclusion filter —
//! consulted by both `begin_deferred_target_selection` and
//! `push_activated_ability_to_stack`'s inline target build — now excludes
//! every object the cost consumed, not just the first.
//!
//! The second test below (`discard_two_cost_excludes_both_discarded_cards`)
//! pins a sibling defect an independent review of this fix's first (later
//! reworked) draft found and reproduced live: a multi-object non-self
//! DISCARD cost had the exact same single-object leak, but with a worse
//! consequence than Samwise's silent fizzle — since a discarded non-token
//! card does NOT cease to exist (CR 704.5d is token-specific), the leaked
//! second discarded card was a *legal, resolvable* target, letting a
//! "Discard two creature cards: Return target creature card from your
//! graveyard to your hand"-shaped ability return one of its own just-paid
//! cards for free. The same generalized fix closes this too, since both
//! defects shared the identical single-object root cause and exclusion seam.
