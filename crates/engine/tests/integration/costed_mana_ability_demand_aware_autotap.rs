//! Demand-aware nested auto-tap for costed mana abilities.
//!
//! Regression for the false "Cannot pay mana cost" when funding a costed mana
//! ability's generic sub-cost consumed already-floated colored mana that the
//! OUTER cost still needed.
//!
//! Repro: cast a `{U}{B}{R}{G}` sorcery with a Dimir Signet (`{1},{T}: Add
//! {U}{B}`), a Gruul Signet (`{1},{T}: Add {R}{G}`), and two Plains. The outer
//! cost reserves both Signets for its four colored shards. Activating Dimir
//! floats `{U}{B}` and a Plains pays its `{1}`. Pre-fix, funding Gruul's `{1}`
//! consumed the floated `{U}` (a tie-break pick) instead of tapping the second
//! Plains, leaving the outer `{U}{B}{R}{G}` short of `{U}` — the spell was
//! wrongly reported unpayable.
//!
//! The fix is three coordinated layers plus a CR 118.10 source-exclusion fix:
//!   - Layer A (planner): when the nested sub-cost's outer-cost colored demand
//!     is known, a generic pip is counted covered ONLY by a non-demanded scratch
//!     unit, so the second Plains is planned to tap.
//!   - Layer B (real spend): the `{1}` payment softly deprioritizes a demanded
//!     color, so it pays from `{W}` (Plains) not the reserved `{U}`.
//!   - Layer C (exclusion): the nested sub-cost auto-tap excludes every source
//!     the outer plan reserved (CR 118.10), so it can't grab a reserved source.
//!
//! All threading is `Option<&ColorDemand>` and `None` on every top-level / cast /
//! affordability path, so non-nested behavior is byte-identical.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 107.4b: Generic mana in costs can be paid with any type of mana.
//!   - CR 118.10: Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell or ability.
//!   - CR 601.2h: Partial payments aren't allowed and unpayable costs can't be
//!     paid; conversely a payable cost must never be reported unpayable.
//!   - CR 605.1b / CR 605.3a / CR 605.3c: Signets are mana abilities; their mana
//!     sub-cost may itself activate further mana abilities, bounded by the
//!     in-flight exclusion chain.
//!
//! This is a *class* regression covering any multicolor cost funded by a mix of
//! costed colored mana rocks and plain mana sources. Driven through the real
//! cast / activation pipeline, not shape assertions.
