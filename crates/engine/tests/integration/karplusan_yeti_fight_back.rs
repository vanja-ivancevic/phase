//! Regression for the fight-back-clause cross-context anaphora bug (CR 608.2c).
//!
//! Karplusan Yeti — Oracle:
//!   `{T}: This creature deals damage equal to its power to target creature.
//!    That creature deals damage equal to its power to this creature.`
//!
//! Clause 2 parses to `DealDamage { amount: Power{Anaphoric}, target: SelfRef }`:
//! "to this creature" is the source object's self-reference (CR 201.5), so the
//! recipient is the Yeti itself, and the `Anaphoric` amount is the power of the
//! creature clause 1 damaged ("that creature", CR 608.2c).
//!
//! The fix is TWO-part:
//!   1. Resolver: `damaged_object_context_from_events` is the weakest
//!      `parent_referent_context_from_events` referent — a single object-targeted
//!      `DamageDealt` event from the parent instruction introduces the "that
//!      creature" antecedent, seeding the `Anaphoric` amount (without it, the
//!      amount resolved to 0 and the Yeti took 0 damage).
//!   2. Parser: `bind_anaphoric_damage_subject_keep_recipient` preserves a
//!      `TargetFilter::SelfRef` recipient verbatim (CR 201.5), so the blanket
//!      anaphoric parent-rewrite no longer clobbers clause 2's recipient to
//!      `ParentTarget` (which would re-aim the fight-back at clause 1's chosen
//!      target instead of the source).
//!
//! This test drives the real `apply` pipeline (activate `{T}`, select target,
//! resolve) and asserts both damage prongs. It FAILS on revert of the parser
//! half (the fought creature is hit twice and the Yeti takes 0).
