//! Regression: Swans of Bryn Argoll's prevention follow-up draws cards for
//! the *damage source's* controller, not Swans's controller.
//!
//! Oracle text: "If a source would deal damage to ~, prevent that damage.
//! The source's controller draws cards equal to the damage prevented this way."
//!
//! Historical bug: `Effect::Draw` short-circuited on `target.is_context_ref()`
//! and returned `ability.controller` (Swans's controller — the prevented
//! player), ignoring the auto-resolved target slot. The fix routes context-ref
//! targets through `resolve_player_for_context_ref`, which reads
//! `state.post_replacement_event_source` and returns the damage source's
//! controller.
//!
//! CR 615.5: Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which
//!           may refer to the amount of damage that was prevented.
//! CR 609.7: Some effects apply to damage from a source — "the source's
//!           controller draws cards equal to the damage prevented this way".
//! CR 121.1: A player draws a card by putting the top card of their library
//!           into their hand.
