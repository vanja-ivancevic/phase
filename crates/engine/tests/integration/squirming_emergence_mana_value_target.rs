//! dq-f: Squirming Emergence — the target's mana-value clause TRAILS its zone
//! clause ("target nonland permanent card in your graveyard with mana value less
//! than or equal to the number of permanent cards in your graveyard"). Before the
//! zone-then-mana-value second pass in `parse_type_phrase_folding_with_ctx`, the trailing
//! "with mana value …" clause was dropped, so every nonland permanent card in the
//! graveyard was a legal target regardless of its mana value.
//!
//! This drives the real cast pipeline: with four permanent cards in the graveyard
//! (permanent-card count = 4), only cards with mana value <= 4 may be targeted.
//! The mana-value-5 card is the discriminator — it is legal iff the fix is
//! reverted.
//!
//! Oracle text (verbatim, Scryfall — Squirming Emergence, DSK):
//!   "Fathomless descent — Return to the battlefield target nonland permanent
//!    card in your graveyard with mana value less than or equal to the number of
//!    permanent cards in your graveyard."
