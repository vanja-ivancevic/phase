//! The Dina "offers, no fast-forward" turn-5 4p board, loaded through the production restore
//! chokepoint — and the row that makes every later acceptance row on this board possible.
//!
//! # Fixture provenance
//!
//! `../fixtures/dina_noff_turn5_4p.json.gz` is derived, not captured. Root of trust is the
//! read-only pristine dump root, NOT any working-directory copy:
//!
//! | artifact | bytes | sha256 |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `/home/lgray/vibe-coding/combofb-dumps-pristine/dina-conqueror-offers-no-ff.zip` (canonical; the sole entry, line 1, of that directory's `MANIFEST.sha256`) | 4 334 390 | `4a285dbf5184545507c0d80183c4b831b3d21738f96728bb9e8eaa942a007d43` |
//! | member `game-state-turn-5-2026-08-05T21-53-17-125Z.json` | 21 442 451 | `14e2fe515310ea34f6c1f52087a0ab274842a3bf69f951b3ceacb93c9a0ca660` |
//! | derived `dina_noff_turn5_4p.json.gz` (this fixture) | 841 479 | `2f074a73963d8f4a87ced4ec3af315e402632046aa3ce9e9b66a9c26960c60cc` |
//!
//! Regeneration is the recipe below **plus the U5 `deck_size` migration**, and together they must
//! reproduce those bytes exactly — `-n` is load-bearing, since without it gzip stamps an mtime and
//! the digest never lands:
//!
//! ```text
//! unzip -p <canonical zip> game-state-turn-5-2026-08-05T21-53-17-125Z.json \
//!   | jq -c '{gameState}' | gzip -9 -n > crates/engine/tests/fixtures/dina_noff_turn5_4p.json.gz
//! ```
//!
//! This capture predates U5, so the recipe alone is NOT sufficient: its bare `"deck_size": 100`
//! must first become the adjacently-tagged `DeckSizeRule` form `{"type":"Exactly","data":100}` —
//! the variant taken from the sibling `format` field, `Commander` here. Piping the raw member
//! straight through does not merely miss the digest; it yields a fixture that
//! `PersistedGameState` cannot deserialize, and a red test on a green engine. Then the retired
//! `combat_phases_started_this_turn` / `end_steps_started_this_turn` keys must be rewritten to
//! `steps_started_this_turn` (`{"BeginCombat": n, "End": m}`, zeros dropped, placed at the first
//! old key).
//!
//! The raw member is 21.4 MB and is deliberately NOT tracked; only the 841 KB `.json.gz` is.
