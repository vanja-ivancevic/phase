//! dq-f: "becomes a copy of target creature card in your graveyard with mana
//! value X" (Lazav, the Multifarious; Likeness Looter). The copy target's
//! mana-value clause TRAILS its zone clause ("… in your graveyard with mana value
//! X"). Before the zone-then-mana-value second pass in `parse_type_phrase_folding_with_ctx`,
//! the trailing "with mana value X" clause was dropped, so (a) the target filter
//! carried no `FilterProp::Cmc` bound to the announced X, and (b) the leftover
//! "with mana value X" fragment sat in front of the ", except …" body and blocked
//! `parse_except_clause`, dropping the copy's `additional_modifications` entirely.
//!
//! `lazav_multifarious_copies_by_mana_value_x` drives the real activation
//! pipeline: with X = 2, only mana-value-2 graveyard creatures may be targeted.
//! `likeness_looter_parses_copy_mana_value_x_shape` pins the parsed AST shape
//! (Cmc{EQ, Variable("X")} in the target filter, plus non-empty
//! additional_modifications) that the runtime test relies on.
