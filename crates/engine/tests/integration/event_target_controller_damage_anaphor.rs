//! GameRunner integration regression for the "that creature's controller"
//! anaphor on ACTIVE-voice damage triggers.
//!
//! CR 120.1 is the rule this file exists to enforce: "an object that deals
//! damage is the source of that damage" — the DEALER — while the recipient is
//! the object that *receives* it. `GameEvent::DamageDealt` carries the two roles
//! in different fields (`source_id` vs `target`), and before the fix under test
//! every one of these cards read the DEALER through
//! `extract_source_from_event`. "That creature's controller" therefore resolved
//! to the attacking creature's own controller, so each card in the class
//! punished its own controller instead of its victim's.
//!
//! Every test here is deliberately **two-sided**: it asserts both that the
//! correct player was affected AND that the wrong player was not. A one-sided
//! assertion ("P1 lost life") passes on the pre-fix engine whenever the board is
//! symmetric, which is exactly the shape these regressions take.
//!
//! Coverage:
//!  1. **Flayed Nim** — `Effect::LoseLife` with a dynamic amount, exercising
//!     `TargetFilter::EventTargetController`.
//!  2. **Bellowing Fiend** — a two-clause chain that damages BOTH the
//!     recipient's controller and "you", so the pre-fix engine doubles up on one
//!     player. Inherently two-sided.
//!  3. **Maarika, Brutal Gladiator** — exercises the other new variant,
//!     `ControllerRef::EventTargetController`, through a CR 120.10 excess-damage
//!     intervening-if and a `Sacrifice` population scope.
//!
//! CR 120.1 + CR 120.10 + CR 109.4 + CR 510.1 + CR 608.2c + CR 608.2h.
