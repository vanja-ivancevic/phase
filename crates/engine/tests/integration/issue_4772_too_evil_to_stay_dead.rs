//! Issue #4772: Too Evil to Stay Dead did nothing when cast WITHOUT paying its
//! Teamwork cost — it spent the mana, let the caster choose a target, and then
//! never returned the creature card to the battlefield.
//!
//! Oracle text (verified against Scryfall, MSH):
//!   "Teamwork 4 (As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may tap any
//!   number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more.)
//!   Choose target creature card in your graveyard with mana value 4 or less.
//!   If this spell was cast using teamwork, instead choose target creature
//!   card in your graveyard. Return the chosen card to the battlefield."
//!
//! Root cause: this lowers to a 3-node chain — a base `TargetOnly` clause (the
//! narrow, mana-value-gated "choose target"), whose `sub_ability` is the
//! teamwork-gated override (`AbilityCondition::AdditionalCostPaidInstead`, the
//! broader "choose target" from `strip_additional_cost_conditional`), whose OWN
//! `sub_ability` is the trailing `Effect::ChangeZone` (`SubAbilityLink::
//! SequentialSibling`, no `else_ability`) that actually returns the card to the
//! battlefield. `resolve_ability_chain` in `crates/engine/src/game/effects/mod.rs`
//! correctly declines to swap the base's effect for the override's when Teamwork
//! was NOT paid, but — before this fix — only its `ConditionInstead` arm had a
//! fallback that walks into `sub.sub_ability` when `sub.else_ability` is `None`.
//! The `AdditionalCostPaidInstead` / `CastVariantPaidInstead` /
//! `TargetHasKeywordInstead` arm had no such fallback: it checked `else_ability`
//! and then unconditionally returned, so the not-swapped branch silently dropped
//! the `ChangeZone` reanimation effect. The fix merges the two arms so all four
//! "instead" condition kinds share the same not-swap tail-runner (mirroring the
//! existing `condition_instead_not_swap_tail_runner_honors_gates` coverage in
//! `crates/engine/src/game/effects/mod.rs`).
//!
//! This test pins BOTH branches:
//!   - WITHOUT teamwork: the mana-value-gated target is returned to the
//!     battlefield (was previously a complete no-op — the bug).
//!   - WITH teamwork: the broader (no mana-value restriction) target is
//!     returned to the battlefield (already worked before this fix, kept here
//!     as a differential control so a revert of either branch fails a test).
