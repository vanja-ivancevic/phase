//! Regression for GitHub issue #6504 — Jeweled Amulet's first ability places a
//! charge counter but must also note the mana type spent to pay its own {1}
//! activation cost (CR 106.1b), and its second (mana) ability must read that
//! noted type back to produce matching mana (CR 106.5: no noted type, no
//! mana). Before the fix, both clauses fell through to `Effect::Unimplemented`
//! and the second ability produced no mana at all regardless of what was
//! noted.
//!
//! Ice Cauldron's type-AND-amount sibling wording reuses the same building
//! blocks: its note stores the exact per-unit payment and its mana ability
//! replays every noted unit (see the Ice Cauldron tests at the bottom).
