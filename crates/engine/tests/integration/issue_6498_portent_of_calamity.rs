//! Issue #6498 — Portent of Calamity: revealed cards cannot be selected;
//! they just go to the graveyard.
//!
//! Oracle: `Reveal the top X cards of your library. For each card type, you
//! may exile a card of that type from among them. Put the rest into your
//! graveyard. You may cast a spell from among the exiled cards without paying
//! its mana cost if you exiled four or more cards this way. Then put the rest
//! of the exiled cards into your hand.`
//!
//! Discord report: after revealing, the player could not keep selected cards —
//! picks dumped to the graveyard. Root cause: "Put the rest into your
//! graveyard" was modeled as `ChangeZoneAll { Exile → Graveyard, TrackedSet }`,
//! so the per-type exile picks (the tracked set) were immediately moved to the
//! graveyard. Also, Dig→RevealTop demotion collapsed X to 1.
//!
//! DISCRIMINATING: with X=5, exile one of each of four types plus a duplicate
//! creature; the unselected revealed creature goes to the graveyard; after
//! declining the free cast, the four exiled picks reach hand via
//! `TrackedSetFiltered { caused_by: Exiled }`, not chain `TrackedSet`.
