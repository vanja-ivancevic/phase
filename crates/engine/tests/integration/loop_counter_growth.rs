//! PR-7 — live preserved-`Generic` counter-growth loop detection (Path C).
//!
//! Companion to `loop_shortcut.rs`'s B5 revocable-∞ tests. Covers the live
//! `interactive_loop_bridge` Path-C arm for a self-refilling OPTIONAL cascade that
//! grows a `Generic` charge counter each cycle (CR 122.1) — the axis
//! `loop_states_cover_modulo_counter_growth` was built for. Because the growing charge
//! is a PRESERVED counter, the constant-depth `loop_states_equal_modulo_resources`
//! disjunct FAILS on this fixture, so the Path-C mark can only land via the new
//! counter-growth disjunct: reverting that disjunct makes `drive_until_marked` time out
//! (the revert-failing assertion).
//!
//! The live proliferate loop (Pentad Prism cast + Kilo/Freed/Relic) is NOT sampled by
//! construction — a `ProliferateChoice` beat every cycle hits the sampler's ring-CLEAR
//! arm (see `loop_shortcut.rs` docs). That acceptance path is covered OFFLINE by
//! `drive_offline_pentad_prism` in `corpus_tests.rs`. This file uses the sampler-visible
//! shape: a self-refilling trigger cascade whose per-cycle charge-put resolves with no
//! prompt.

    // 1. It must be an ACTIVATION, not a trigger cascade. `try_offer_object_growth_shortcut`
    //    requires a non-empty `last_loop_action_sequence` whose every step is
    //    `is_voluntarily_repeatable()` (CR 601.2a / CR 602.2 / CR 605.3a — casting, activating, and
    //    mana abilities are each a voluntary choice at priority; the helper's own annotation names
    //    all three). A trigger cascade drives itself and records no
    //    action sequence, so it reaches only the Path-C silent mark — which registers no backing
    //    set at all. The cascade version of this fixture grew its counters and then sat at
    //    `Priority` with no offer.
    // 2. The activation must CREATE A TOKEN. `apply_action`'s `ActivateAbility` arm opens a period
    //    only for a token-creating ability (or continues one already open for this controller);
    //    every other activation CLEARS the sequence. A `{0}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.`
    //    version therefore also sat at `Priority` — each activation wiped the very sequence the
    //    offer needs. Mana activations arm it by a different path entirely
    //    (`record_mana_loop_action_step`).
    //
    // So the reachable production shape for a `+1/+1` ∞ display registration is a counter growth
    // riding a token-creating or mana-producing carrier. That is a real constraint on the class,

/// `analysis::resource::grown_beneficial_counter_deltas`, which admits a pair on `a > b` with

/// registered while the live bearer carries none of it. While the channel published bare counter
/// TYPES, the display could only draw such a mark by finding a matching row in the object's own
/// `counters` map — there was none — so a real, accepted, registered `∞` rendered NOWHERE. That
/// is the subsystem's own polarity violated: it may leave an `∞` standing one boundary too long,
/// never hide a real one.
///
/// HOW THE `0` IS REACHED, and what is production vs. harness — stated rather than blurred.
/// The MATERIALIZATION is entirely production: a real offer, a real `DeclareShortcut`, a real
/// `RespondToShortcut::Accept` driving `materialize_object_growth_shortcut` ->
/// `current_period_counter_growth` -> `register_unbounded_counter_targets`. The PRECONDITION —
/// the bearer sitting at zero — is harness-injected, and deliberately so: this pump is
/// `PutCounter{this creature}`, so the only object it can ever reach is the rider itself, and the
/// rider was necessarily present for the period that recorded it. The state is nonetheless a real
/// one the engine can reach (`AbilityCost::RemoveCounter` and CR 122.3's `+1/+1`/`-1/-1`
/// annihilation both decrease a battlefield permanent's counters), and it is legal on its own
/// terms: a 2/2 base creature with no `+1/+1` counters is a 2/2, so no state-based action fires.
/// It is injected as a faithful stand-in for that class, not smuggled in as production shape.
///
/// WHY THE CLEAR CANNOT BE UNDONE BY THE ACCEPT. The accept consumes the proposal already latched
/// in `WaitingFor::RespondToShortcut` and re-derives against LIVE state, which is the point: with
/// the rider cleared, `before` has no `Plus1Plus1` entry and `after` has one, so the `a > b`
/// admission is reached by production code. And `materialize_object_growth_shortcut` only STASHES
/// the concrete finite growth (`register_pending_materialization`) — it is applied at the next
/// phase/step boundary — so the rider's live count is still `0` at `derive_views`. RG-1 and the
/// post-accept re-check below assert both halves rather than assuming them.

/// `BTreeMap<PlayerId, BTreeSet<(ObjectId, CounterType)>>`: the `BTreeSet` dedupes WITHIN a seat

/// unconditionally, so two controllers whose accepted loops pump the same pair emitted the pair
/// TWICE. Both rows are byte-identical — the count is read from `state.objects` keyed only by
/// `(id, ct)`, with no seat input — so this is a duplicate, never a "whose count wins" question.
/// Downstream, all five render sites (`board/PermanentCard`, `card/ArtCropCard`,
/// `card/CardPreview`, `controls/AttackTargetPicker`, `hud/DialogAttachmentCard`) key their pill
/// on the counter TYPE alone, so a duplicate row is two React
/// children sharing one key: undefined reconciliation plus a dev warning. The frontend cannot fix
/// this — deduping engine-published game state in the display layer is exactly what this codebase
/// forbids — so the collapse belongs here, at the seam that owns the row set.
///
/// WHY A DIRECTLY-CONSTRUCTED STATE IS HONEST HERE. Reachability is STRUCTURAL, not scenario-
/// dependent: `register_unbounded_counter_targets` is the store's single write authority and it
/// keys strictly by the winning controller (`game::engine::materialize_object_growth_shortcut`
/// passes `proposal.proposer`), so "two seats hold the same pair" is reached by two accepted
/// proposals in either order and carries no per-seat state beyond the key. Driving two full
/// concurrent loop accepts would exercise the offer machinery, not this projection. The
/// registrations below therefore go through that same production write authority; only the
/// scheduling around them is harness-built.
///
/// THE NEGATIVE CONTROL IS IN THIS FIXTURE, NOT A SIBLING. A dedupe is only half-tested by a
/// state where every seat holds the SAME pair: that pins "collapses enough" while leaving
/// "collapses too much" free, so narrowing the set key to `ObjectId` alone would red nothing.
/// One seat here therefore also holds a DISTINCT pair on the SAME object, which must survive
/// alongside the collapsed one. Both directions are live against one state: dropping the dedupe
/// yields three rows, narrowing the key to the object yields one, and the assertion below names
/// exactly two. It also pins the merged multi-seat ORDERING — rows arrive sorted by
/// `(ObjectId, CounterType)`, which nothing else asserts beyond a single seat.
