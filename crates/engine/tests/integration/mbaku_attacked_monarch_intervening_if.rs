//! M'Baku, Jabari Chieftain — both printed abilities.
//!
//! **Ability 1** — "At the beginning of your end step, if there is no monarch,
//! **target opponent** becomes the monarch." The designation must go to the
//! DECLARED TARGET. `Effect::BecomeMonarch` used to be a unit variant whose
//! resolver read `ability.controller`, so this crowned M'Baku's own controller
//! — the one player the clause exists to deny, and the player whose coronation
//! structurally disables ability 2 (an opponent could never become the monarch
//! off this card).
//!
//! **Ability 2** — "Whenever a creature attacks one of your
//! opponents, **if that player is the monarch**, that creature gets +1/+1 and
//! gains trample until end of turn."
//!
//! Before this change the intervening-if was dropped entirely
//! (`condition: null` plus a self-flagged `SwallowedClause/Condition_If`), so
//! the buff applied to every creature attacking any opponent regardless of
//! monarch status.
//!
//! Three independent failure directions are discriminated here:
//!   1. **Parser subject axis missing** — `parse_inner_condition` rejects
//!      "that player is the monarch", the condition stays `None`, and the buff
//!      applies unconditionally (Test 2 catches this).
//!   2. **Anaphor not rebound** — the condition parses as
//!      `IsMonarch { ScopedPlayer }`, which
//!      `targeting::extract_player_from_event` resolves to the ATTACKING
//!      player for an `AttackersDeclared` event, so nothing is ever buffed
//!      (Test 1's positive assertion catches this).
//!   3. **CR 508.5 anchor precedence wrong** — the source's own combat latch
//!      answers instead of the triggering attacker's defender, so the buff
//!      tracks whoever M'Baku is attacking rather than whoever the buffed
//!      creature is attacking (Test 1's two-attacker split and Test 4 catch
//!      this).
//!
//! CR references:
//!   - CR 508.5 / CR 508.5a: an ability referring to both an attacking creature
//!     and a defending player means the player THAT creature is attacking, and
//!     in multiplayer that player is determined individually per attacker.
//!   - CR 310.9d: a battle's protector, and a planeswalker's controller, are the
//!     defending player for an attack against them (Test 5's planeswalker).
//!   - CR 603.2 / CR 603.2c: the trigger fires once per matching attacker.
//!   - CR 603.4: the intervening-if is checked at fire time AND again as the
//!     ability resolves (Test 3).
//!   - CR 725.1: the monarch is a single-player designation.
//!   - CR 702.19a: trample.
