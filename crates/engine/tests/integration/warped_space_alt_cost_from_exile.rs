//! CR 118.9 + CR 601.2a (#7575): "Once each turn, you may pay {0} rather than
//! pay the mana cost for a spell you cast from exile." (Warped Space) lowered
//! its whole line to `Effect::Unimplemented`: `parse_spells_alternative_cost`
//! strict-failed on the origin-zone qualifier after "spell you cast".
//!
//! Class (measured against card-data.json, 4 cards, all Unimplemented before
//! the fix): Warped Space, Dragon's Smile, Tlincalli Hunter ("from exile"),
//! Darksteel Monolith ("a colorless spell you cast from your hand").
//!
//! The runtime needed no change: `granted_spell_alternative_cost` evaluates the
//! `affected` filter through the spell-filter path, whose
//! `FilterProp::InZone` arm compares the cast's ORIGIN zone. These tests host
//! the static on a plain enchantment — Room door gating is #7573's merged
//! concern, not this one.
