//! Issue #6437 — Fight Rigging: "Exiles the targeted creature instead of
//! putting a counter on it."
//!
//! Fight Rigging: "At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a +1/+1
//! counter on target creature you control. Then if you control a creature
//! with power 7 or greater, you may play the exiled card without paying its
//! mana cost." Collector's Cage carries the identical shape on an activated
//! ability instead of a trigger. Both chain a TARGETED clause (`PutCounter`)
//! before a linked-exile clause (`CastFromZone { ExiledBySource }`) in the
//! SAME resolution.
//!
//! Root cause: the default target-propagation arm in `resolve_chain_body`
//! (`game/effects/mod.rs`, guarded by a `has_independent_target_slot` check)
//! copies a parent's already-chosen object targets into a following
//! sequential sibling whenever the sibling's own effect carries no
//! recognized "independent" target slot. `TargetFilter::ExiledBySource` is a
//! context-ref (`is_context_ref()`), so `extract_target_filter_from_effect`
//! reports no slot for it, and pre-fix that read as "not independent" —
//! copying the counter's chosen creature into the `CastFromZone` sub's empty
//! `targets`. `cast_from_zone::resolve` then found a non-empty `target_ids`
//! and never reached its own `ExiledBySource` → `exile_links` fallback,
//! instead processing the TARGETED CREATURE as the card to license: since the
//! creature sits on the battlefield (not Hand/Graveyard/Exile),
//! `grant_lingering_permissions` routed it through the exile-delivery batch,
//! moving the targeted creature into exile instead of giving it a counter.
//! `should_propagate_parent_targets` (the sibling authority used by the
//! declined-optional-branch dispatcher and others) carries the matching fix,
//! refined to keep composed filters that ALSO reference `ParentTarget`
//! (Jodah's "put the rest ... except the hit" cleanup) propagating as before.
//!
//! Oracle text is quoted verbatim from Scryfall (`client/public/card-data.json`).
