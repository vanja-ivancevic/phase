//! Integration test for GitHub issue #3302 — Breach the Multiverse's per-player
//! reanimation chain.
//!
//! Printed Oracle text:
//!   "Each player mills ten cards. For each player, choose a creature or
//!    planeswalker card in that player's graveyard. Put those cards onto the
//!    battlefield under your control. Then each creature you control becomes a
//!    Phyrexian in addition to its other types."
//!
//! The spell's controller (the caster) chooses ONE creature/planeswalker card
//! from EACH player's graveyard, those chosen cards enter the battlefield under
//! the caster's control, and every creature the caster controls becomes a
//! Phyrexian.
//!
//! This file drives the REAL `apply` pipeline in a 2-player game: Breach is cast
//! for free from the caster's hand, the mill + per-player choose loop park
//! interactive `ChooseFromZoneChoice` prompts, each pick is answered via a real
//! `GameAction::SelectCards`, and every observable (zone, controller, subtype)
//! is engine-produced.
//!
//! The scenario is built to discriminate two distinct bugs:
//!   * Clause-3 ORIGIN: "those cards" must be scanned from the GRAVEYARD (where
//!     the choose left them), not the impulse-default exile. A wrong origin
//!     leaves the chosen creatures in the graveyard (no reanimation).
//!   * Tracked-set EXTEND-vs-FRESH (CR 608.2c + CR 603.7): clause 1 mills cards
//!     (publishing a "Milled" tracked set). The FIRST per-player pick must START
//!     a FRESH chosen-card set, NOT extend the milled set — otherwise the milled
//!     creatures reanimate alongside the chosen ones ("those cards" = the chosen
//!     cards only). Each graveyard therefore holds an EXTRA creature and a milled
//!     creature that must REMAIN behind.
//!
//! CR 400.7: a card stays in its current zone until an effect moves it.
//! CR 608.2c: "those cards" refers to the cards chosen in the preceding clause.
//! CR 110.2a: "under your control" sets the entering object's controller.
//! CR 205.1b: "becomes a Phyrexian" adds the Phyrexian creature subtype.
