//! Issue #8762: `Effect::Counter`'s rider branch in `resolve_chain_body`
//! consumed the CR 614.1a graveyard-exile rider and returned, discarding every
//! `SequentialSibling` link behind it — where the `CastFromZone` branch of the
//! same function already runs such a tail (#6945). Spelljack's third sentence ("You
//! may play it without paying its mana cost for as long as it remains exiled.")
//! and No Escape's "Scry 1." therefore never ran.
//!
//! Three parts, each with its own counter-probe:
//! 1. the rider branch now runs the rider's direct sequential tail for the
//!    families `counter_tail_family_has_runtime_evidence` admits;
//! 2. `affected_objects_with_causes` stamps the countered card `Exiled` when the
//!    counter's exile rider applied to it — without that stamp the tail's
//!    `TrackedSetFiltered { caused_by: Exiled }` anaphor matched nothing, so the
//!    permission grant resolved against an empty set even when it ran;
//! 3. the rider's printed condition decides WHETHER it applies to the concrete
//!    countered spell — `counter::resolve` asks
//!    `cast_from_zone::graveyard_exile_rider_applies_to` once, when it chooses
//!    the destination, and records the answer in `exile_rider_countered_ids`;
//!    the provenance stamp reads that record (an Adventure spell changes face
//!    between the two, CR 715.4). Thranduil's Decree ("If a PERMANENT spell is
//!    countered this way") exiled a countered instant on `main`; it now goes
//!    to its owner's graveyard (CR 701.6a), unstamped and without the
//!    permission.
//!
//! Corpus (`client/public/card-data.json`): 20 counter heads carry the exile
//! rider, 6 of them a tail — Spelljack, Thranduil's Decree, Kheru Spellsnatcher
//! (`CastFromZone`, one family in two modes), No Escape (`Scry`), Delay (`GenericEffect`),
//! Devious Cover-Up (`ChangeZone` → `Shuffle`). The first four change here; Delay's
//! tail and its rider's time counters are issue #8795
//! (`counter_rider_time_counters_8795`); Devious Cover-Up is out of scope with a
//! measured reason, pinned below as unchanged.
