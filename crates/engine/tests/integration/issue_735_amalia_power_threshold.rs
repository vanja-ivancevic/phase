//! Runtime regression for GitHub issue #735 — Amalia Benavides Aguirre's
//! "destroy all other creatures if its power is exactly 20" must be a
//! CONDITIONAL board wipe gated on Amalia's own power, not an unconditional
//! wipe on every lifegain.
//!
//! https://github.com/phase-rs/phase/issues/735
//!
//! Amalia: "Whenever you gain life, ~ explores. Then destroy all other
//! creatures if its power is exactly 20."
//!
//! Two production edits make the sub-ability condition load-bearing at runtime:
//!   - Edit A (`oracle_util.rs`): "exactly N" → `Comparator::EQ`, so the
//!     "if its power is exactly 20" clause parses at all. Without it the
//!     DestroyAll clause fails to parse and the wipe is unconditional.
//!   - Edit B (`oracle_effect/conditions.rs`): the player-subject lifegain
//!     trigger binds "its power" to Amalia (the ability SOURCE), so at
//!     resolution the check reads Amalia's power. With the scope forced to
//!     `CostPaidObject` there is no cost-paid object for a lifegain trigger, so
//!     the check resolves 0 ≠ 20 and the wipe NEVER fires — the
//!     `amalia_power_20_wipes_others` test below is the load-bearing proof.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 608.2h: an effect that requires information from a specific object
//!     (here Amalia's power) determines it once, when the effect is applied.
//!   - CR 208.1: a creature's power can be modified by effects — Amalia's power
//!     is raised to exactly 20 here by stacking +1/+1 counters.
//!   - CR 701.44a: to explore, reveal the top library card; a land goes to hand
//!     (no +1/+1 counter, no choice) — a land-on-top makes explore resolve with
//!     no pause, so Amalia's staged power is unchanged by the explore.
