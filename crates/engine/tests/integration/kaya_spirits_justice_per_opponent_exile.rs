//! Per-other-player iterated exile — Kaya, Spirits' Justice's −2 ability.
//!
//! Printed −2: "Exile target creature you control. For each other player, exile
//! up to one target creature that player controls."
//!
//! The printed second sentence uses the word "target" for a VARIABLE,
//! per-iterated-player set of permanents. CR 115.1c + CR 601.2c require those
//! targets to be announced as the ability is activated and chosen through the
//! targeting machinery (legality / hexproof / shroud / protection enforced). The
//! engine has no machinery for a per-iterated-player set of announced target
//! slots (`collect_target_slots` is fixed-count; `repeat_for` resolves at
//! resolution time, not announcement), so the printed-`target` clause is
//! honestly `Effect::unimplemented` rather than silently routed through a
//! resolution-time choose (which would bypass targeting). This is asserted by
//! `printed_target_form_is_unimplemented`.
//!
//! The NON-target form ("…exile up to one creature that player controls") IS a
//! resolution-time choice (CR 115.10a + CR 608.2c: the affected permanent is
//! chosen on resolution and is NOT a target). It parses to the per-player
//! iterated `ChooseFromZone { zone_owner: EachOpponent }` primitive: for EACH
//! OTHER player in APNAP order the controller chooses up to one creature THAT
//! player controls and every chosen permanent is exiled
//! (`ChangeZoneAll { TrackedSet }`). The controller is never offered as an
//! iterated chooser (the `EachOpponent` vs `EachPlayer` discriminator).
//!
//! The runtime tests drive the REAL `apply` pipeline in a 3-player game: a
//! sorcery carrying the per-other-player clause is cast, the choose loop parks
//! interactive `ChooseFromZoneChoice` prompts, each pick is answered via a real
//! `GameAction::SelectCards`, and every observable zone is engine-produced.
//!
//! CR 101.4: per-player choices are made in APNAP order.
//! CR 102.2: "each other player" excludes the controller.
//! CR 400.7 + CR 608.2c: the implicit "those" mass move acts on exactly the
//! chosen permanents.
