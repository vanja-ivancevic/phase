//! CR733 coverage for the effect-driven combat-membership family.
//!
//! Five authorities put an object into or out of combat by effect rather than by
//! declaration — `combat::enter_attacking`, `combat::place_attacking_alongside`,
//! `combat::place_blocking`, `combat::mark_attacker_blocked`, and
//! `remove_from_combat::remove_object_from_combat` — and every one of them wrote
//! its mutation raw. A retained-prefix replay therefore had no record that a
//! creature was ever attacking, blocking, or blocked by effect.
//!
//! They share ONE parameterized command rather than five sibling variants. The
//! axis stays inside a single CR section, as the categorical boundary rule
//! requires: CR 506.3a-g govern putting a permanent onto the battlefield
//! "attacking or blocking" in one breath, CR 506.4 governs removal, and the
//! declaration-side rules delegate back to it (CR 509.1g ends "See rule 506.4.").
//!
//! The load-bearing reason the defender must be RECORDED rather than re-derived
//! is CR 508.4: "its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a
//! defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects it's
//! attacking." That is a choice the rules assign to a player. The resolve-time
//! authority approximates it from ambient state —
//! `defending_player_for_enters_attacking` reads the source's own attacker
//! entry, then `state.current_trigger_event`, then a controller-scan of the live
//! attacker list, then falls back to the first opponent. None of that is
//! reconstructible at replay time, so re-deriving would silently seat the
//! creature against a different defender. `replay_installs_recorded_defender_
//! when_ambient_derivation_diverges` is the test that pins it, and it carries a
//! probe proving the ambient path really would answer differently.
