//! CR 604.2 + CR 611.3b vs CR 611.2a + CR 514.2 — the lifetime of a
//! damage-prevention shield is decided by its PROVENANCE, and the engine records
//! that provenance exactly once, at creation, in `ReplacementDefinition::expiry`.
//!
//! A printed static ability's prevention effect (Solitary Confinement, Nine
//! Lives, Fog Bank, Pariah, ...) is active "as long as the permanent with the
//! ability remains on the battlefield" (CR 604.2) — it has no turn window and
//! carries `expiry: None`. A prevention effect created by the RESOLUTION of a
//! spell or ability lasts "as long as stated by the spell or ability creating
//! it" (CR 611.2a), and its creator stamps that window.
//!
//! `turns::execute_cleanup` previously keyed its CR 514.2 prune on
//! `ShieldKind::is_shield()`, which is TRUE for both classes — so every printed
//! prevention card lost its shield at the first cleanup step and was dead for the
//! rest of the game. Every test in this file therefore CROSSES A TURN BOUNDARY: a
//! same-turn test passes with the bug present and proves nothing.
//!
//! Positive half (must survive): T1, T5.
//! Negative half (must still expire): T2 (ability-duration carrier), T4 (one-shot),
//! T7 (no window on either carrier — the engine's turn default), T8's step 5.
//! T8 is the "longer than a turn, but not forever" middle case.
//!
//! Oracle text is verbatim from Scryfall; the harness rules this file obeys
//! (stocked libraries, `active_player` reach-guards after every crossing, the
//! alternating End/Upkeep crossing idiom, and `#[must_use]` combat reach-guards)
//! are documented at their helpers below.
