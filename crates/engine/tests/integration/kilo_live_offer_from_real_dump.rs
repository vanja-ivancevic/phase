// engine-citation-gate: symbol anchors only
//! FIX-1 + FIX-2 + FIX-3 (CR 732.2a) acceptance — the Kilo, Apogee Mind + Freed from the Real +
//! Relic of Legends + Pentad Prism proliferate loop, driven from the REAL 4-player playtest dump
//! that failed to offer the ∞-charge shortcut.
//!
//! The loop (measured, mana-neutral, +1 charge/cycle, unbounded — `WinKind::Advantage`, CR 104.4b):
//! activate Relic #1 ("Tap an untapped legendary creature you control: Add one mana of any color"),
//! tap Kilo (402) for BLUE → Kilo's "becomes tapped" trigger proliferates (CR 701.34a), +1 charge
//! on Pentad (405) → activate Freed #1 ("{U}: Untap enchanted creature"), the {U} paid by the Blue.
//!
//! This exercises all three fixes end-to-end through the PUBLIC `apply()` boundary (the
//! "combo FIRES in a real game" criterion): FIX-3 (the conditional load migration
//! `GameState::migrate_transient_loop_sequence` drops the loaded save's 6 stale pinless steps
//! because the dump is at `Priority`, not a shortcut window), FIX-1 (record + replay the
//! tap-target / mana-color / proliferate-target pins), FIX-2 (the counter-growth cover disjunct
//! accepts the +1-charge/cycle growth).
//!
//! DISCLOSED (FIX-3): a loaded PRE-fix save carries 6 pinless steps that the migration drops on
//! load; one live cycle rebuilds a clean, fully-pinned 2-step period the detection drive can replay.
//! The `kilo_reinjected_pinless_history_suppresses_offer` test is the matched-pair proof that the
//! migration is load-bearing (re-injecting the stale prefix flips the offer OFF).

/// Nothing pinned this relation before: the token family's analog
