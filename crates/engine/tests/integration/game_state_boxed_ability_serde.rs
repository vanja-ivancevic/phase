//! Serde transparency for the boxed `ResolvedAbility` storage sites.
//!
//! `StackEntryKind::Spell.ability`, `StackEntryKind::ActivatedAbility.ability`
//! and `GameState::pending_trigger` were retyped from inline values to
//! `Box<_>` to cut `GameState`'s inline stack footprint. Persisted sessions and
//! host checkpoints cross the wire through exactly these fields, so the wire
//! shape must not have moved.
//!
//! The existing `game_state_serializes_and_roundtrips` unit test cannot see
//! this: it round-trips `GameState::default()`, whose stack is empty and whose
//! `pending_trigger` is `None`, so every retyped field is degenerate there and
//! the test would pass for any layout. These fixtures are populated instead.
//!
//! **What actually discriminates here, and what does not.**
//!
//! `boxing_introduces_no_wrapper_level_in_the_wire_shape` makes two different
//! kinds of assertion, and only one of them can fail on its own:
//!
//! * **The discriminator: the key-path assertions.**
//!   `stack[i]["kind"]["data"]["ability"].get("effect").is_some()` — and the
//!   same for `pending_trigger.ability` — is what proves `Box` adds no wrapper
//!   level. If `Box<T>` serialized as anything other than `T` (a `{"Box": …}`
//!   tag, a one-element sequence, an extra nesting level), `"effect"` would not
//!   be a direct child at that path and these assertions go red. They are
//!   absolute, not relative: nothing in the fixture can make them pass
//!   vacuously.
//!
//! * **Necessary but insufficient: the control comparison.**
//!   `StackEntryKind::TriggeredAbility.ability` was **already**
//!   `Box<ResolvedAbility>` before this change, so `assert_eq!(ability,
//!   control)` pins the newly-boxed fields against a spelling whose wire format
//!   is known-good. That catches an *asymmetry* — one field picking up a rename,
//!   a `flatten`, or a different container attribute than its long-boxed
//!   sibling. It cannot catch a *uniform* regression: if `Box<T>` stopped being
//!   transparent, the control would grow the same wrapper as the fields under
//!   test and the comparison would still hold. So the control comparison alone
//!   would be vacuous; it earns its place only alongside the key-path
//!   assertions, which is why both are present.
//!
//! Do not delete the key-path assertions on the grounds that the `assert_eq!`
//! against the control "already covers it". It does not.
