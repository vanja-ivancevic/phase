//! Runtime regression for the CR 611.2a CONTINUOUS chosen-permanent damage
//! redirection created by a resolving spell (Heroic Sacrifice, Gideon's
//! Sacrifice, and the Saving Grace attachment-host sibling).
//!
//! Heroic Sacrifice was, in sequence: (a) silently misparsed into a card-level
//! `ShieldKind::Prevention { All }` that DELETED the damage, dropped the
//! "creatures you control" victim leg and swallowed its CR 603.7a delayed
//! trigger; then (b) an honest `Effect::Unimplemented` gap. Both left the card a
//! complete no-op — casting it protected nothing.
//!
//! These tests drive the real cast pipeline (`GameRunner::cast(..).resolve()`)
//! followed by the real damage pipeline, so they exercise parser + targeting +
//! resolver + `damage_done_applier` end to end. Every Oracle text here is
//! verbatim Scryfall text.
//!
//! SCOPE / KNOWN GAP (pre-existing, NOT introduced or asserted here): Heroic
//! Sacrifice's third sentence — "When that creature dies this turn, put its
//! counters on up to one target creature you control and draw a card." — is
//! chunked with the "and draw a card" conjunct as a SIBLING of the
//! `CreateDelayedTrigger` rather than inside its payload, so the draw happens on
//! resolution instead of on death. That is identical before and after this
//! change (it is present in the committed `data/card-data.json` baseline) and
//! lives in the clause-assembly/delayed-payload subsystem, not the damage
//! redirection this file covers. These fixtures therefore stock a library so the
//! stray draw is inert, and deliberately assert NOTHING about the draw — pinning
//! the wrong placement would bless it.
