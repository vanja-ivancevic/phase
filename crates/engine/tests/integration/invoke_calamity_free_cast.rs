//! Integration test for issue #2385 — Invoke Calamity resolves with no effect;
//! the free-cast window from graveyard/hand never opens.
//!
//! Oracle:
//!   "You may cast up to two instant and/or sorcery spells with total mana value
//!    6 or less from your graveyard and/or hand without paying their mana costs.
//!    If those spells would be put into your graveyard, exile them instead.
//!    Exile Invoke Calamity."
//!
//! Root cause: the whole resolution text was swallowed into a
//! `GraveyardCastPermission` static (which only functions for permanents on the
//! battlefield), leaving the spell's `abilities` empty — so casting Invoke
//! Calamity did nothing. The fix routes the line to a real interactive
//! `Effect::FreeCastFromZones` that opens a budgeted free-cast window
//! (`WaitingFor::CastOffer { FreeCastWindow }`).
//!
//! CR 608.2g: an effect may instruct a player to cast spells during resolution.
//! CR 601.2: "up to two" — the controller may cast 0, 1, or 2 spells.
//! CR 202.3: the running total mana value of the chosen spells must stay ≤ 6.
//! CR 614.1a: spells cast this way are exiled instead of going to the graveyard.
