//! Issue #1536 — Rebound (CR 702.88) end-to-end discriminator suite.
//!
//! Consuming Vapors is the canonical Rebound spell. The reminder text is:
//!   "Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves.
//!    At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile
//!    without paying its mana cost.)"
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 702.88a: Rebound spells cast from hand exile on resolution and
//!     create a delayed triggered ability that offers a free recast at the
//!     controller's next upkeep.
//!   - CR 702.88c: multiple instances of Rebound are redundant.
//!   - CR 603.7a: delayed triggered abilities are created during resolution.
//!   - CR 603.7b: a delayed trigger fires only once unless it has a stated
//!     duration.
//!   - CR 603.7c: if the object is no longer in the expected zone at the
//!     time the delayed trigger resolves, the ability resolves but won't
//!     affect it.
//!   - CR 603.7d: source of the delayed trigger is the spell that created
//!     it; controller is the player who controlled the resolving spell.
//!   - CR 608.2n: instant/sorcery spells go to owner's graveyard as the
//!     final part of resolution (displaced by Rebound's exile-instead).
//!   - CR 704.5d: tokens cease to exist in zones other than the battlefield
//!     (Rebound copies of tokens cannot be cast again, so Rebound must not
//!     arm on token spells).
//!   - CR 514.2: "until end of turn" effects end at cleanup — the granted
//!     `ExileWithAltCost { duration: Some(UntilEndOfTurn) }` is pruned at
//!     cleanup if the controller declined or failed to cast.
//!
//! Most tests hand-build the minimum state needed and exercise
//! `stack::resolve_top` plus the relevant prune helpers directly so each
//! assertion discriminates the pre-fix bug from the post-fix correct
//! behavior. The Terramorph regression uses the committed integration
//! card-data fixture so it can drive the reported real-card cast/search path
//! without reparsing the full production export.
