//! **Gates a card prints that the engine does not actually gate**, and the
//! runtime proof that fixing them changes what the game allows. Most fixes
//! here are in the PARSER; section 4 (Dandân) is the exception — its gate
//! types correctly and the fix is a `layers.rs`/`combat.rs`/`static_abilities.rs`
//! runtime-anchor change (CR 506.2 + CR 508.1c + CR 508.5).
//!
//! The file started at issue #8183 (a gate condition the parser could not type
//! lands as `StaticCondition::Unrecognized`, which the layer system evaluates
//! as ALWAYS TRUE — fail-open) and now covers four layers of the same genus:
//!
//!   * sections 1–3 — #8183's own three: a gate that failed to TYPE;
//!   * sections 4–5 — the defending-player gates. Ayesha's gate (section 5)
//!     and Graxiplon's (section 1) are parser gaps like #8183's;
//!     **Dandân's (section 4) is different in kind** — its gate types
//!     correctly and the ANCHOR cannot bind;
//!   * section 6 — the group-share counting gap: the gate types, the anchor
//!     binds, and the gate is STILL inert because of what the filter carries.
//!
//! CR 604.1: a static ability is "simply true" — its gate decides whether it
//! currently applies, so a gate the parser drops or mis-polarizes silently
//! turns the restriction on (or off) for every board state.
//!
//!  1. **Graxiplon** — "This creature can't be blocked unless defending player
//!     controls three or more creatures that share a creature type."
//!     The `unless` NEGATION was dropped at the `can't be blocked` fallback
//!     branch, leaving a bare `Unrecognized` that evaluates TRUE, so
//!     `CantBeBlocked` applied unconditionally: Graxiplon was permanently
//!     unblockable. #8183 restored the NEGATION but not its operand: the gate
//!     became `Not(Unrecognized)`, and since `Unrecognized` evaluates TRUE the
//!     `Not` evaluates FALSE, so the restriction applied on NO board. That was
//!     an honest improvement over permanent unblockability, but it is still not
//!     the printed card. The `defending player controls ` leaf of
//!     `parse_control_scope_prefix` types the operand, so the gate finally
//!     answers the board: with the printed gate UNMET the `Not` is TRUE, the
//!     restriction APPLIES, and the block is ILLEGAL (CR 509.1b — the
//!     defending player checks each creature for blocking restrictions, and an
//!     evasion ability creates one).
//!
//!  2. **Training Drone** — "This creature can't attack or block unless it's
//!     equipped." The anaphoric "it" in the gate was never resolved to the
//!     source, so the gate stayed `Not(Unrecognized)` = FALSE and the
//!     restriction NEVER applied: an unequipped Training Drone could attack.
//!     With the fix the gate is `Not(SourceIsEquipped)` (CR 301.5a — the
//!     creature an Equipment is attached to is the "equipped creature"), so an
//!     unequipped Drone cannot be declared as an attacker (CR 508.1c) and an
//!     equipped one can.
//!
//!  3. **Ancestral Katana** — `Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has "This
//!     creature has first strike as long as it's attacking."` The predicate was
//!     split on the ` as long as ` INSIDE the quoted granted ability, so the
//!     granted first strike was destroyed and its gate was mis-attached to the
//!     +2/+2. With the fix the quoted ability survives as a granted static whose
//!     own gate is evaluated against the EQUIPPED CREATURE (CR 611.3a — a
//!     continuous effect from a static ability applies at any given moment to
//!     whatever its text indicates; CR 508.1k — an attacking creature).
//!
//!  4. **Dandân — the defending-player anchor, now bound at declaration time.**
//!     "Can't attack unless defending player controls an Island" is the same
//!     printed grammar as section 5's on the OTHER side of combat. It was a
//!     RUNTIME ANCHOR gap rather than a parser gap: the gate typed correctly,
//!     but attack legality was checked before the candidate was recorded as an
//!     attacker (CR 508.1k), so the anchor resolved to nothing and the gate
//!     read UNMET on every board. `ConditionContext::declared_attack`
//!     (CR 506.2 + CR 508.1c + CR 508.5) now carries the attack target under
//!     validation into the condition evaluator, and a creature-level query
//!     that cannot bind either anchor DEFERS to the per-pairing authority
//!     (`combat::attacker_can_attack_target`) instead of evaluating the gate
//!     unanchored — the row below now asserts the fixed behavior.
//!
//!  5. **Ayesha Tanaka, Armorer — the defending-player count that never typed.**
//!     "Can't be blocked as long as defending player controls three or more
//!     artifacts" — and, on the same combinator, **Graxiplon**'s "…unless
//!     defending player controls three or more creatures that share a creature
//!     type" from section 1 — both fell to `Unrecognized` because the
//!     control-count combinator had only `you control` and `your opponents
//!     control` leaves. With the `defending player controls ` leaf the count is
//!     scoped through `ControllerRef::DefendingPlayer` and the anchor binds: for
//!     a `CantBeBlocked` static whose source IS the attacking creature (Ayesha's
//!     own SelfRef static), the source is already in `combat.attackers` when
//!     CR 509.1b's blocking-restriction check runs (CR 508.5 / CR 508.5a
//!     determine which seat). This does NOT generalize to a static granted by a
//!     REMOTE carrier that need not itself be attacking (Tanglewalker,
//!     `defending_player_controls_combat_anchor.rs`'s T3) — there the anchor is
//!     the affected attacking creature, not the carrier (CR 508.5).
//!
//!  6. **The group-share counting gap.**
//!     **Littjara Kinseekers** ("if you control three or more creatures that
//!     share a creature type", CR 603.4) and **Synchronized Eviction** ("costs
//!     {2} less to cast if you control at least two creatures that share a
//!     creature type") both parsed, both reported as supported, and both were
//!     WRONG: `parse_type_phrase_folding` consumes the relative clause into a
//!     `FilterProp::SharesQuality { reference: None }`, which is a
//!     group-SELECTION marker that `filter::evaluate_shares_quality` answers
//!     TRUE for every object. Inside a `QuantityRef::ObjectCount` that silently
//!     drops the constraint, so the gate fired on ANY three (respectively two)
//!     creatures. The marker is now lifted onto the counting authority,
//!     `QuantityRef::ObjectCountBySharedQuality { aggregate: Max }`.
//!
//!     These are the first CAST-SIDE rows in this file, and the inert marker
//!     reaches the runtime through two different consumers: a trigger's
//!     intervening-if (Littjara, driven through the cast pipeline per the
//!     `/card-test` recipe) and a cost-modifying static (Synchronized Eviction,
//!     via `casting::self_spell_cost_condition_matches` →
//!     `layers::evaluate_condition`, asserted through `can_cast_object_now` at a
//!     tuned pool after `hollow_one_cost_reduction.rs`).
//!
//! Every card here is built from VERBATIM Oracle text through
//! `GameScenario`/`GameRunner`, so the whole production route runs: Oracle text
//! → static parser → `StaticDefinition.condition` → `evaluate_condition*` →
//! combat legality / cost modification / layer evaluation. No test in this file
//! asserts an AST shape as its primary claim; the AST assertions present are
//! explicitly labelled reach-guards.
//!
//! # FIXTURE CONTRACT
//!
//! Three separate rounds of this work produced three instances of ONE failure
//! class: an assertion that could not fail for the reason it claimed, because
//! the fixture never reached the state under test. Per-row repairs did not
//! hold, because each covered only the instance it found. The properties are
//! therefore stated once, here, and constructed by helpers rather than by each
//! row.
//!
//! **R1 — every combat fixture leaves at least one legal block available.**
//! The engine's auto-pass loop AUTO-SUBMITS the declare-blockers step when
//! `valid_blocker_ids` is empty, so a fixture where the restriction under test
//! correctly applies and nothing else is blockable never enters the step at
//! all. Adding defenders does not help — the step is skipped on "no legal block
//! anywhere", not on "no blockers". Constructed by declaring TWO attackers in
//! every combat row: the card under test and an unrestricted ally. Checked by
//! `declare_attackers_and_reach_blockers`, which asserts both `valid_blocker_ids`
//! and `valid_block_targets` are non-empty on arrival; each row then also
//! asserts the defender's blocker lists the ALLY among its legal targets, which
//! is what makes its `Err` on the card under test specific rather than global.
//!
//! **R2 — `state.all_creature_types` matches the board.**
//! `filter::shared_quality_values` filters an object's subtypes against that
//! registry (CR 205.3m) and `GameScenario` leaves it EMPTY, so every bucket is
//! empty, `AggregateFunction::Max` answers 0, and every gate-MET fixture
//! silently reads UNMET. `seed_creature_types_from_board` derives it from the
//! battlefield.
//!
//! **That seeding is structural ONLY for rows that enter combat**, because
//! `declare_attackers_and_reach_blockers` is what calls the seeder. A row that
//! does NOT enter combat is obliged to call `seed_creature_types_from_board`
//! itself — as the Littjara and Synchronized Eviction rows do. There is no
//! compiler or helper protection against omitting it: a non-combat row with an
//! unseeded registry gets `Max = 0`, every gate reads UNMET, and any "no
//! counter" / "not castable" assertion passes for the wrong reason, which is
//! exactly the vacuous negative R4 exists to forbid.
//!
//! Board-derived seeding is a SUBSET of CR 205.3m's full list. That is faithful
//! only while nothing reads the registry as a whole, which `Keyword::Changeling`
//! does. A changeling row is admissible under exactly one of two discharges and
//! must state which: (1) seed the full CR 205.3m list, or (2) prove the row's
//! assertion is invariant under registry extension. The Littjara pair takes (2).
//!
//! **R3 — nothing between declare-attackers and declare-blockers needs player
//! input.** The pass loop stops on any interactive `WaitingFor`. Ayesha's own
//! attack trigger lowers to `Effect::Dig`, which with a non-empty library yields
//! a `DigChoice` and strands the loop. It is a no-op here only because
//! `GameScenario` builds every library EMPTY unless a fixture explicitly adds
//! cards. A row that ever needs library cards must resolve the prompt rather
//! than pass through it. The helper's arrival assertion names this property so
//! such a failure reads as "R3 violated" rather than as an opaque panic.
//!
//! **R4 — negative assertions are paired, and the pair differs in exactly one
//! variable.** Every row whose primary claim is an ABSENCE — a block that must
//! be `Err`, a counter that must not be placed, a cast that must not be legal —
//! has a PRESENCE sibling on an otherwise identical fixture. For the group-share
//! pairs the creature COUNT is held equal across the pair, so the pre-fix inert
//! count answers the same in both and the pair isolates the lift rather than the
//! board size; the Synchronized Eviction pair additionally holds the mana pool
//! byte-identical, since there the pool is the instrument.
