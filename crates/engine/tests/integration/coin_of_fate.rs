//! Coin of Fate (Artifact {1}{W}) — the source-bound cost-paid exile partition.
//!
//! ```text
//! When this artifact enters, surveil 1.
//! {3}{W}, {T}, Exile two creature cards from your graveyard, Sacrifice this
//! artifact: An opponent chooses one of the exiled cards. You put that card on
//! the bottom of your library and return the other to the battlefield tapped.
//! You become the monarch.
//! ```
//!
//! Every test here drives the REAL pipeline — `GameAction::ActivateAbility` →
//! the engine's own cost windows (`WaitingFor::PayCost` for the graveyard exile,
//! `WaitingFor::ManaPayment` for `{3}{W}`) → stack resolution →
//! `WaitingFor::ChooseFromZoneChoice` answered with a real
//! `GameAction::SelectCards` — and asserts only OBSERVABLE outcomes: which
//! player is prompted, which cards are offered, and where every object ends up.
//! No AST shapes are asserted; the parser-level guards for this change live in
//! `crates/engine/src/parser/oracle_effect/imperative.rs`'s unit tests.
//!
//! Two rules ride on these assertions:
//!   * CR 400.7j + CR 601.2h + CR 602.2b — the activation cost moved two cards
//!     to exile (a public zone), so this same ability's effect can find exactly
//!     those two and nothing else. The board deliberately carries an UNRELATED
//!     creature card already sitting in exile: a candidate pool that scanned the
//!     exile zone instead of the cost-payment record would offer it.
//!   * CR 608.2c + CR 608.2d — "that card" is the opponent's pick and "the
//!     other" is its complement. The engine forwards the CHOSEN cards as the
//!     continuation's targets and the UNCHOSEN complement only on the
//!     continuation's immediate sub-ability, so the two halves must land in
//!     different zones.
//!   * CR 608.2c + CR 609.3 — when the eligible pool has shrunk, the complement
//!     can be EMPTY (one survivor) or the pool empty outright. An empty
//!     complement is a bound result, not an unassigned slot: "the other" then
//!     names no object, the return does as much as possible (nothing), and the
//!     rest of the printed instruction still happens.
