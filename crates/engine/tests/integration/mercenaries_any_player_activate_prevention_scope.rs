//! Mercenaries (Ice Age) — "{3}: The next time this creature would deal damage
//! to you this turn, prevent that damage. Any player may activate this ability."
//!
//! Misparse-backlog category #9 ("Wrong player/controller scope"): the "to you"
//! recipient of the prevention shield is the ABILITY'S CONTROLLER — and because
//! "Any player may activate this ability", the controller is whoever activated
//! it (CR 602.2a), NOT Mercenaries' static controller. Before the fix,
//! `parse_oneshot_damage_replacement` hardcoded `target: TargetFilter::Any` in
//! its prevention branch (and `parse_damage_target_phrase` had no "to you" arm),
//! so the shield had ZERO recipient restriction — it would prevent Mercenaries'
//! damage to ANY player.
//!
//! The fix parses "to you" → `Player { Controller }` and bridges it into
//! `Effect::PreventDamage { target: TargetFilter::Controller }`; at runtime
//! `resolve_player_for_context_ref` resolves `Controller` to the activator, and
//! `untargeted_damage_filter` installs the shield scoped to
//! `Player { Specific(activator) }` (CR 615.1a).
//!
//! This drives the REAL pipeline: build Mercenaries from verbatim Oracle text,
//! have the OPPONENT (P1) activate the ability through `apply()` (legal only via
//! `activator_filter = All` from "Any player may activate"), resolve it, then
//! push actual damage events through the production replacement pipeline
//! (`replace_event`).
