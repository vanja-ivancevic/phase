//! Namor, Atlantean King — the attacked-player predicate and the
//! "attacking that player" defending-player anaphor.
//!
//! Verbatim Oracle text (Scryfall oracle id
//! `171a0a09-4aee-466c-aebd-3b0d4c1f51b4`):
//!
//! > Whenever Namor attacks a player who has more life than you, other
//! > creatures you control attacking that player get +2/+0 until end of turn.
//!
//! Two independent defects shipped in the same line, and each has its own
//! discriminating rows here:
//!
//! **Defect A — the event predicate was dropped.** `parse_attack_target`
//! discarded its remainder, so "who has more life than you" vanished
//! (`valid_target: null`) and the trigger fired on EVERY player attack. Rows
//! `fires_when_.._more_life` / `does_not_fire_when_..` / `..equal_life..`
//! discriminate it.
//!
//! **Defect B — the pump was board-wide.** With "attacking that player"
//! unconsumed by `parse_type_phrase_folding`, the clause fell through to the numeric
//! imperative path, which emits the documented
//! `Effect::Pump { target: TargetFilter::Any }` sentinel. `TargetFilter::Any`
//! matches unconditionally, so +2/+0 landed on every permanent on the
//! battlefield — both players' creatures, Namor itself, and lands. Row
//! `pumps_only_co_attackers_of_the_same_defender` discriminates it three ways
//! at once.
//!
//! A third row set covers the SIBLING class this change unlocks: the `YouAttack`
//! cards that put the same anaphor in a TARGET filter (Ordruun Mentor, Echoing
//! Assault). Their slot-build door does not carry `trigger_source`, so before
//! `ability_utils::filter_needs_trigger_source` they enumerated ZERO legal
//! targets on any multi-attacker declaration and CR 603.3d removed the trigger
//! from the stack. Those rows deliberately use a TWO-attacker board, because a
//! single-attacker board passes without the fix.
//!
//! **Defect C — the sibling class bound the WRONG player in multiplayer.**
//! "Whenever you attack a player" is CR 508.3e, not CR 508.3a: the trigger
//! source need not be attacking (Echoing Assault is an Enchantment and never
//! can be), so CR 508.5 — which speaks only to "an ability of an attacking
//! creature" — cannot supply "that player". The declaration used to collapse
//! into ONE firing bound to the batch-global defender, so on a two-defender
//! board one attacked player's firing went missing entirely and the surviving
//! firing answered for the wrong lane. Row
//! `ordruun_mentor_binds_each_firing_to_its_own_attacked_player` discriminates
//! it, and reverting the parser's attacked-player object collapses it back to a
//! single firing.
//!
//! CR references:
//!   - CR 508.3e: "Whenever [a player] attacks [another player]" triggers for
//!     each attacked player, and does not trigger on planeswalker/battle
//!     attacks. Confirmed by the printed Echoing Assault ruling ("triggers once
//!     for each player you attacked").
//!   - CR 508.5 / CR 508.5a: an ability of an attacking creature that refers to
//!     a defending player means the player THAT creature is attacking, and in
//!     multiplayer that player is determined individually per attacker. This is
//!     Namor's and Owlbear Cub's binding rule — NOT the CR 508.3e siblings'.
//!   - CR 603.2: a trigger event (including a relative clause inside it) is
//!     checked once, when the event occurs.
//!   - CR 603.3d: a triggered ability with no legal choice for a required
//!     target is removed from the stack.
//!   - CR 611.2c: a continuous effect from a resolved ability fixes its
//!     affected set when it begins.
//!   - CR 119.1: life totals.

/// multiple players in the same declare attackers step, Echoing Assault's last
/// ability triggers once for each player you attacked."
///
/// The binding this row pins cannot come from CR 508.5: that rule supplies a
/// defending player to *an ability of an attacking creature*, and Ordruun
/// Mentor is not attacking here (its sibling on this arm, Echoing Assault, is
/// an Enchantment and can never attack at all). The referent comes from the CR
/// 508.3e trigger event itself, which
/// `trigger_matchers::matching_you_attack_events_by_attacked_player` splits
/// into one synthesized `AttackersDeclared` per attacked player.
///
/// This row is the discriminating one: before the split, both firings collapsed
/// into a single trigger bound to the batch-global defender, which offered BOTH
/// lanes to one target slot. It fails if the split regresses (one firing, or a
/// firing that can reach across defenders) and it fails if the enumeration door
/// regresses (an empty slot → CR 603.3d removal).
