//! Runtime regression for the "reveal cards from the top of your library until
//! you reveal X [type] cards" + "put any number of those onto the battlefield,
//! rest on the bottom in a random order" pattern (Aurora Awakener).
//!
//! Aurora Awakener (ETB): "reveal cards from the top of your library until you
//! reveal X permanent cards, where X is the number of colors among permanents
//! you control. Put any number of those permanent cards onto the battlefield,
//! then put the rest of the revealed cards on the bottom of your library in a
//! random order."
//!
//! The single true engine gap was VARIABLE-LENGTH termination — revealing until
//! N (dynamic) matches, not until the first match. This drives the real
//! `Effect::RevealUntil` resolver (with the new `count` parameterization and the
//! `ChooseAnyNumber` matched-set disposition) and submits the keep-selection
//! through `apply()` (the production `DigChoice` handler), then asserts:
//!   * the until-loop terminates at exactly X matches (not 1, not all),
//!   * the chosen permanent reaches the battlefield,
//!   * the rest of the revealed cards (non-chosen matches + misses) go to the
//!     BOTTOM of the library,
//!   * X = 0 reveals nothing.
//!
//! REVERT-PROOF: if `count` were reverted to `Fixed(1)` the loop would stop at
//! the FIRST permanent and the second permanent (`perm_b`) would never be
//! revealed — the `assert!(revealed.contains(&perm_b))` and the "perm_b on the
//! bottom" assertions both flip. If the `ChooseAnyNumber` disposition were
//! reverted to `KeepEach`, no `DigChoice` would be surfaced and the
//! `WaitingFor::DigChoice` match below would panic.
