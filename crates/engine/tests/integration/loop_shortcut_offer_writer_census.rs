//! §6 R8 — THE OFFER-WRITER SURFACE TRIPWIRE, AS A TRACKED TEST RATHER THAN A
//! WRITTEN NUMBER.
//!
//! CR 732.2a: only the player with priority may suggest a shortcut, and the
//! engine's record of a live suggestion is a `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` write.
//! The 5d period machinery adds certification paths, so the standing question
//! "did a new path learn to certify without declaring or driving?" needs an
//! instrument that re-measures on every `cargo test -p phase-engine` run. A
//! number written into a plan cannot fire; this can.
//!
//! WHAT IT PINS, and why it is an INVARIANCE claim rather than a re-measurement:
//! the offer-writer surface across `crates/engine/src` and `crates/phase-ai/src`.
//! NO NUMBER IS RESTATED HERE — not even to narrate the incident that caused this
//! rewrite. This header once carried a production/test pair that had drifted from
//! the assert below; quoting that pair *here* would reintroduce the defect,
//! because probe-pin validates only between its BEGIN/END markers and any number
//! above them is unanchored by construction. The incident, with both figures, is
//! recorded in `probe-pin/engine-census.toml`, whose anchors an adjudicator has to
//! edit anyway. The assert below is where the pair is authoritative. NO rustdoc in
//! this file states either half of it — the adjudication history names SUPERSEDED
//! test-half values only, each chain deferring to the assert rather than restating
//! it (the chains end at "the value the assert below pins", "the pinned value", and
//! "the assert below is the authority for the pair"; no single phrase is shared, so
//! none is quoted as if it were). Both
//! figures do recur inside the assert's own failure MESSAGE, beside the literal
//! they describe, where an adjudicator editing one has the other in view; P1's
//! anchors cover that literal and one sentence of that message. NOTHING covers
//! rustdoc, which is why the rustdoc now carries no figure OF THE PINNED PAIR.
//! ⚠ READ THAT SCOPE LITERALLY — it was written wider once and was false. This file's
//! SIBLING test (`the_cfg_scope_classifier_...`) still has its OWN asserted figures
//! restated in its rustdoc, and NOTHING pins them: that test builds its
//! input as an in-binary String, so no bind-mount can reach it and the manifest
//! declares it unpinnable. Those restatements can go stale exactly as the pinned
//! pair's did. They are disclosed rather than struck because striking them would edit
//! a test this commit does not pin and was not reviewed against. The
//! PROBE-PIN block below re-measures both halves on every `probe-pin check` — its
//! rows anchor the pinned tuple and the adjudication sentence inside the assert —
//! so moving either without regenerating the block turns the pin red. A failure
//! reads *"5d (or a successor) changed the offer-writer surface"*, not
//! *"someone re-measured"*.
//!
//! THE ANCHOR IS BARE — `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut {`, with no `= ` / `Ok(`
//! qualifier. A prefix-anchored regex cannot be completed by adding prefixes:
//! `Some(WaitingFor::LoopShortcut {`, `vec![WaitingFor::LoopShortcut {`, a bare
//! literal in argument position and `return WaitingFor::LoopShortcut {` are all
//! constructions, and a match-arm PATTERN is a *consumer* whose appearance is as
//! worth surfacing as a writer's. Dropping the qualifier pins the whole surface
//! and has no form gap by construction.
//!
//! Pattern copied from `no_top_level_test_binaries.rs` — the in-tree precedent
//! for a `#[test]` that reads the source tree through
//! `Path::new(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"))` and asserts a structural invariant.

// ── PROBE-PIN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The claims below are MEASURED, not asserted in prose: each row is a mutation of
// the walked tree plus the verdict it produced. Regenerate with
//   cargo probe-pin run --write probe-pin/engine-census.toml
// A row whose anchor stops matching is a number that moved without an adjudication.
//
// DISCLOSURE — the SHAPE named as the anchor lint's residual now occurs in a MANIFEST for the
// first time. The predicate is stated because a bare "first time" is false: `docs/probe-pin.md`
// already prints an anchor of this shape as a worked example, so the shape's first appearance
// in-tree is the doc's, not this file's. What is new is the first one AUTHORED IN A SHIPPING
// MANIFEST. `docs/probe-pin.md` rejects anchors embedding a line number, and names one
// shape it cannot reject: a positional integer in a `("<path>", <int>)` slot. The block
// below carries anchors of that shape. In each, the integer is a COUNT (a per-file multiset
// entry), which is the legitimate form the lint deliberately admits — never a line. Said
// here because no instrument distinguishes the two. The doc's REVISIT CONDITION is narrower
// than the shape and is NOT met by this commit: it asks for a revisit only "if an anchor of
// the `("<path>", <int>)` shape is ever authored with a *line* in the integer slot". No
// revisit is owed here; what is owed is this disclosure.
// ⚠ THAT QUOTATION IS UNANCHORED, and saying so is the point: no probe in the manifest matches
// it, and `docs/probe-pin.md` is not one of this resource's deps, so editing the doc leaves this
// quotation silently stale. It is quoted rather than paraphrased because a paraphrase was wrong
// here once; it is disclosed rather than pinned because pinning another file's prose from this
// file would make an unrelated doc edit fail the census pin.
//
// VENUE LIMIT — the block below is checked by ONE venue: the Tiltfile's `probe-pin-census`
// resource, locally, on engine-source edits. It is NOT checked in GitHub CI, and CI
// enrollment is policy-blocked (`.agents/pr-review-policy.toml` `[hard_stops]` lists
// `.github/workflows/**`). A green block in a merged commit is not a CI-verified block.

         `game/visibility.rs`'s `filter_state_for_viewer` writer is EXCLUDED by name and not \
         silently: it re-emits an ALREADY-minted offer into a per-viewer projection and cannot \
         run unless `state.waiting_for` is already a `LoopShortcut`. `game/derived_views.rs`'s \
         `derive_views` arm is excluded on the same ground, and is what moved the production \
         half: it is a match PATTERN on `state.waiting_for` inside a projection taking \
         `&GameState`, so it mints no offer and cannot run unless a `LoopShortcut` is already \
         open. That file holds no declare-time authority call. The exhaustive \
         `redact_paid_cast_cleanup_authority` match in `game/visibility.rs` is an additional \
         benign read on the same ground: it projects/redacts an already-open offer and owns no \
         declaration or certification authority.\n\
         A new PRODUCTION site in a certification-path file means the period machinery may \
         certify without declaring or driving — §10 ruling condition (2), i.e. \
         answer-legality-at-certification becomes OWED WORK and the U-series stops. A new READ \
         site is the benign case; adjudicate, do not relax the assert.\n\
         THE TEST HALF HAS BEEN ADJUDICATED SEVEN TIMES (12 ⇒ 13, §6 R27 (b)'s schema read in \
         `engine/src/analysis/resource.rs`; 13 ⇒ 14, 5d U4's `u4_park_on_offer` fixture in \
         `engine/src/game/engine.rs`, which parks a constructed board on an offer so §6 R28 \
         arm (b) can assert the DECLARE firewall refuses a hostile `template.owner`; 14 ⇒ 16, \
         BOTH in `phase-ai/src/policies/loop_shortcut.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)]` module — \
         `bounded_offer_declaring`, a builder minting an offer whose certificate carries a \
         real `per_cycle` so the proposer-elimination arm can be driven, and `certificate_of`, \
         a read accessor for the same rows. PRODUCTION STAYED AT 22 across that change, which \
         is the half this pin exists to protect: the new policy arm READS the certificate and \
         writes no offer). FOURTH ADJUDICATION, 16 => 17: the cap-round row \
         `the_bounded_offer_charges_a_forced_victim_it_publishes_no_point_for` in \
         `engine/src/analysis/resource.rs`, whose `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` DESTRUCTURE reads the \
         offer it minted to assert the combination that decoupling CR 732.2a publication from CR \
         704.5a charging makes reachable: `schema.points` EMPTY while `victim_slot` still names the \
         forced victim. A READ, not a writer. PRODUCTION STAYED AT 22 with an IDENTICAL per-file \
         multiset, and that conjunct is what makes this the benign case rather than a surface \
         change; if it moves again, name the new site here too rather than only moving the \
         number.\n\
         FIFTH ADJUDICATION, 17 => 21: publishing the bounded offer's own CR 732.2a \
         `declaration` on `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` added two in-crate rows that spell the anchor \
         FOUR times between them. Named individually, because this census counts LINES (its \
         `classify()` is `line.contains(needle)`, deliberately replacing a construction-shaped \
         detector), so a mint and a read of the same fixture are two counted sites: (1) \
         `engine/src/game/visibility.rs` row D5-h's MINT, `d5h_offer` — one local helper called \
         twice, staging a declaration whose pins are all-seat vs. one naming a hidden object; \
         (2) `engine/src/game/visibility.rs` row D5-h's READ, `d5h_projected_declaration` — one \
         local helper destructuring `filter_state_for_viewer(..).waiting_for`, called three \
         times (hidden/viewer, hidden/proposer, public); (3) \
         `engine/src/ai_support/candidates.rs` row D6-n's MINT, `d6n_offer` — one local helper \
         called twice, `declaration: None` vs `Some(..)` and nothing else; (4) \
         `engine/src/ai_support/candidates.rs` row D6-n's READ — the reach-guard destructure \
         that asserts the staged offer really `is_bounded()` and really publishes a point \
         BEFORE the negative claim, without which that row would pass on the wrong conjunct. \
         Site (4) was NOT predicted (the plan budgeted 20 on the reading that D6-n's assertions \
         touch only `legal_actions`); the measurement wins and the site is named rather than the \
         row contorted to hit the budget. ALL FOUR ARE `#[cfg(test)]` FIXTURES: none writes an \
         offer the period machinery can certify. PRODUCTION STAYED AT 22 with an IDENTICAL \
         per-file multiset — C2b adds the field INSIDE existing literals and patterns and \
         introduces no new production anchor line.\n\
         SIXTH ADJUDICATION, 21 => 22: the frame-wise charge row \
         `the_bound_charges_the_frame_wise_loss_not_the_period_endpoint_pair` in \
         `engine/src/game/engine.rs`, whose `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` DESTRUCTURE reads the \
         offer it minted through `try_offer_bounded_cycle_shortcut_metered` to assert that the \
         published `victim_slot` magnitude and `seat_life_charge` divisor come from the \
         period's frame-wise accumulation while `delta` still carries the endpoint pair. A \
         READ, not a writer, in a `#[cfg(test)]` scope. PRODUCTION AND THE PER-FILE MULTISET \
         ARE BOTH UNMOVED — the row adds no production anchor line.\n\
         SEVENTH ADJUDICATION, 22 => 24: the consumption-ceiling rows in \
         `engine/src/game/engine.rs` share ONE `#[cfg(test)]` fixture helper, \
         `signmix_offer_at_responder_beat`, which spells the anchor twice — once to destructure \
         the offer `try_offer_bounded_cycle_shortcut_metered` returned, once to re-read that \
         offer's schema for the published count before taking the production DECLARE path to \
         the CR 732.2b response window, where the consumption re-derivation is resolved on the \
         live proposal. Two READS in one helper, not two writers: the helper mints through the \
         production seam and writes no offer of its own. PRODUCTION AND THE PER-FILE MULTISET \
         ARE BOTH UNMOVED.\n\

    // per-call-site *convention*: it could only catch a site that forgot the
    // coverage half, never a site that ran BOTH gates against a differently-derived
    // `required` list — and it could not see `build_bounded_declaration`, which
    // PUBLISHED a declaration while running NEITHER gate (the C2b review's finding
    // F1). The two gates are now composed once, in
    // `analysis::decision_template::declaration_conforms`, and the invariant this
    // conjunct pins is the stronger one: production validates pin values in exactly
    // ONE place, that place runs both halves, and every declare-time site routes
    // through it. A relapse — a second `validate_pins(` consumer, or a declare site
    // that stops routing through the authority — fails the counts below.
