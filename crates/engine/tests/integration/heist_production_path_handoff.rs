//! CR 701.x (Heist — MTG Arena digital-only) — production-path integration test.
//!
//! The unit-level tests in `effects/heist_tests.rs` exercise `heist::resolve`
//! and `heist::resolve_exile` directly. This file drives the parsed
//! `Effect::Heist` through the production interaction path the maintainer
//! flagged as the risky part, covering two complementary layers:
//!
//! 1. **The resolver handoff** (the four tests named
//!    `heist_production_path_*` and `heist_look_step_*` and
//!    `heist_target_filter_*`): drive a parsed Heist ability through
//!    `resolve_ability_chain` → `WaitingFor::ChooseFromZoneChoice` →
//!    `engine::apply(GameAction::SelectCards)` (the production answer
//!    handler — the same function `GameRunner::act` calls) →
//!    `drain_pending_continuation` → `HeistExile` finalizer. This is the
//!    Heist-specific risk surface: partition semantics, the
//!    `cont.chain.targets = chosen` injection, and the `HeistExile`
//!    continuation drain.
//!
//! 2. **The full-card end-to-end** (the test
//!    `heist_full_production_path_grenzo_cast_etb_end_to_end`): cast a
//!    REAL Heist card (Grenzo, Crooked Jailer) whose Oracle text is parsed
//!    by the production parser (`parse_oracle_text` via
//!    `add_creature_to_hand_from_oracle`), drive the cast → mana payment
//!    → ETB trigger → target selection → `ChooseFromZoneChoice` →
//!    `GameAction::SelectCards` → finalizer pipeline end-to-end. A
//!    regression in any of the Heist-specific risk surfaces — parser
//!    producing `Effect::Heist`, engine raising the look-step prompt,
//!    partition logic, or finalizer — fails this test loud.
//!
//! Together these cover the full production path the maintainer listed:
//! parsed `Effect::Heist` → `WaitingFor::ChooseFromZoneChoice` →
//! `GameAction::SelectCards` answer → `pending_continuation` drain →
//! final exiled / cast-permission state.

// (parse_effect_chain → resolve_ability_chain → WaitingFor → SelectCards →
// drain). This test covers the OTHER half the maintainer called out: the
// cast layer and target declaration, driving the parsed Heist ability
// through `GameAction::CastSpell`, the modal `ChooseBranch` routing, and
// the spell-targeting `WaitingFor::TargetSelection` for the opponent.
//
// We use `Grave Expectations` (MTG Arena digital set, {U}{U} sorcery,
// modal "Heist" vs "Exile up to three target cards from your opponents'
// graveyards. You gain 3 life.") as the canonical real card. Casting it
// exercises every production stage end-to-end; a regression in the
// targeting phase for `Effect::Heist.target` would surface here because
// the cast never reaches `ChooseFromZoneChoice` if target declaration
// fails.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Full production-path regression for the Heist mechanic. Casts a REAL
// card whose Oracle text contains "heist" — **Grenzo, Crooked Jailer**
// ({4}{B}{R}, 6/4, "When Grenzo enters and at the beginning of your
// upkeep, heist target opponent's library.") — through the production
// cast + trigger pipeline end-to-end:
//
//   CastSpell → ManaPayment → ETB trigger queued →
//   WaitingFor::TriggerTargetSelection (the targeting phase requests an
//   opponent player) → ChooseTarget { Player(P1) } → trigger resolves →
//   WaitingFor::ChooseFromZoneChoice → GameAction::SelectCards → drain →
//   HeistExile finalizer.
//
// All ability definitions come from the production parser
// (`parse_oracle_text` via `add_creature_to_hand_from_oracle`) — the test
// does NOT hand-construct the Heist ability or inject the target. This
// exercises the full Heist production surface:
//   (a) the trigger parser producing a `ChangesZone` trigger whose body
//       parses to `Effect::Heist` with the right `TargetFilter`;
//   (b) the engine raising `TriggerTargetSelection` when the ETB fires;
//   (c) the resolver raising `ChooseFromZoneChoice` (the look step);
//   (d) `engine::apply(GameAction::SelectCards)` injecting the chosen
//       card into `cont.chain.targets` (the partition);
//   (e) the `HeistExile` finalizer exiling face-down + granting
//       permanent any-color cast permission.
//
// A regression in ANY of (a)–(e) — including a parser regression that
// drops the Heist trigger to `Unimplemented`, or a targeting phase that
// doesn't surface the opponent-player slot — fails this test loud.
//
// Fixture: this test references "bear cub", "goblin arsonist", "elf
// replica", and "forest" as quoted string literals so
// `scripts/gen-test-fixture.py --check` keeps them in
// `tests/fixtures/integration_cards.json.gz`. Grenzo himself is built from
// inline Oracle text via `add_creature_to_hand_from_oracle` (no fixture
// entry needed), which is the cleanest way to exercise the production
// parser path on this branch's Heist parser change before the card-data
// pipeline regenerates `card-data.json`.
