//!   - Contested Game Ball ("the attacking player gains control of ~ and untaps it")
//!   - Spider-Woman, Stunning Savior ("Venom Blast — Artifacts and creatures your

//!
//! Building-block win (named-token parsing): "Primo, the Indivisible, a legendary

//!
//! Building-block win (token-count multiplier): Ojer Taq, Deepest Foundation —

//!
//! Now supported (S25 P2e — Moonlit Meditation): "The first time you would create

//! gated by `ReplacementCondition::FirstTokenCreationEachTurn`, whose
//! `CopyTokenOf { target: AttachedTo, count: EventContextAmount }` execute makes
//! host-copies. Per-PLAYER once-per-turn window (the Oracle's "you"), tracked via
