//! CR 601.2c runtime fixture for the mana RECIPIENT + COUNT SOURCE role pair.
//!
//! "The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for
//! each target the spell requires." A mana sentence that names a recipient
//! ("target player adds …", CR 106.4) AND a target-derived count ("… for each
//! card in target opponent's hand") declares TWO independent instances of the
//! word "target". Before roles were modeled, both collapsed onto
//! `ability.targets[0]` and the resolver guessed which was which from the
//! production's quantity shape.
//!
//! This drives the REAL cast pipeline — announcement, slot building, positional
//! target selection, resolution — and asserts the two slots stay independent:
//! the mana lands in the RECIPIENT's pool while the COUNT reads the
//! COUNT-SOURCE player's hand. The two players are different AND their hand
//! sizes are different, so any slot mix-up changes both the destination pool and
//! the amount; the test cannot pass vacuously.
//!
//! NOTE ON /card-test's verbatim-Oracle-text rule: this test uses a SYNTHETIC
//! card. No printed card declares both a mana recipient and a target-derived
//! count in one sentence (0 cards in the class today), so verbatim Oracle text
//! is unavailable by construction. CR 601.2c makes the shape legal Magic and it
//! is the class the role model exists to express. The single-role HALVES of the
//! class ARE validated against real verbatim Oracle text by the parser tests for
//! Jetfire ("Target player adds that much {C}" — recipient), Jeska's Will
//! ("Add {R} for each card in target opponent's hand" — count source), and
//! Carpet of Flowers, and at runtime by the in-crate `effects::mana` tests.
