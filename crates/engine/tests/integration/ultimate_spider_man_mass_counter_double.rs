//! Ultimate Spider-Man (back face) — "Whenever you attack, double the number of
//! each kind of counter on each Spider and legendary creature you control."
//!
//! CR 701.10e (counter multiplication) + CR 115.1 / CR 608.2d (the recipient is a
//! DESCRIBED population, not a target, so it is enumerated while the effect is
//! applied) + CR 205.4a (the right conjunct "legendary creature" leads with a
//! SUPERTYPE, so the union must keep both legs).
//!
//! Before the fix three independent defects stacked up:
//!   1. the parser gated the non-targeted "each kind of counter on <descriptor>"
//!      form to an honest `Effect::Unimplemented`, so the trigger did nothing;
//!   2. `Effect::Double { DoubleTarget::Counters }` had no battlefield-population
//!      tier at all, so even a lowered effect would have doubled nothing; and
//!   3. `parse_type_phrase_folding_with_ctx`'s bare "and"/"or" branch rejected a
//!      supertype-led right conjunct, collapsing the population to
//!      `Typed{[Subtype("Spider")]}` with NO controller — which both misses the
//!      controller's legendary creatures and reaches across the table.
//!
//! This test drives the real combat pipeline (declare attackers → `YouAttack`
//! trigger onto the stack → resolve). The declared attackers are cleared before
//! the combat-damage step (the `archnemesis_you_attack_enchanted_player.rs`
//! recipe), so every asserted counter delta comes solely from the resolved
//! trigger.
