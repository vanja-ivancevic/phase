// engine-citation-gate: symbol anchors only
//! CR 732.2b/c stage 2 — EFFICACY of a polled seat's loop-shortcut response.
//!
//! CITATION FORM: rule NUMBER only. The number is itself the greppable heading —
//! `grep '^732.2c' docs/MagicCompRules.txt` resolves any citation below. Line
//! anchors are forbidden here (this file is enrolled in
//! `subsystem_citations_are_symbol_anchored`) because `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`
//! is gitignored and re-fetched per checkout, so a line anchor is pinned to

//!
//! `ai_support::smart_shortcut_response` shipped with a POSSIBILITY predicate
//! only: any meaningful priority action bought a `Shorten`, i.e. a real priority
//! window. That is right for a seat holding a Bolt and wrong for a seat holding
//! a fetchland — activating Terramorphic Expanse satisfies CR 732.2c's "must
//! make a different game choice" while changing nothing about the loop, so the
//! window is spent achieving nothing.
//!
//! Stage 2 is AI POLICY, not a rule: CR 732.2b grants an
//! unconditioned accept-or-shorten option and states no efficacy criterion. The
//! rows below pin the policy's two arms and, more importantly, pin the ONE
//! thing an over-broad version would destroy — that a seat holding real
//! interaction still gets its window.
//!
//! # Mutant discipline
//!
//! Two mutants are named per row, and every row states which one flips it:
//! * **DROP** — delete stage 2 from `smart_shortcut_response` (both arms), i.e.
//!   restore the shipped one-stage predicate.
//! * **TRIVIALIZE** — make the stage-2 predicate constant. For arm (B) that is
//!   `shortcut_efficacy::filter_is_actor_owned ≡ true` (everything looks
//!   confined); for arm (A) it is deleting the `crowned_winner` guard.
//!
//! A row whose expected value equals the SHIPPED value cannot be flipped by
//! DROP — its discriminating power is entirely in TRIVIALIZE, and that is
//! stated on the row rather than papered over.

// --- Oracle-text constants, and what each one's provenance ACTUALLY is ---
//
// Two provenances ship here and they are deliberately not conflated, because
// "verbatim Oracle text" is a claim about a printing and only some of these
// make it.
//
// (1) SIBLING-FIXTURE PROVENANCE — the four loop-shape constants below are
//     byte-identical copies of the shipped constants in
//     `tests/integration/loop_shortcut.rs`, which does not present them as any
//     card's Oracle text either. They exist to reproduce that file's mutual-drain
//     loop, and copying them verbatim is what keeps the two files' loop shape
//     identical. MEASURED against MTGJSON `AtomicCards.json` (`.data[*][0].text`):
//       * `DRAIN_CLERIC` IS one printing's complete Oracle text (Epicure of Blood,
//         Marauding Blight-Priest — 2 exact matches);
//       * `BLOOD_SIPPER` matches NO card, not even as a substring;
//       * `KICKOFF` / `TARGETED_KICKOFF` match no card's complete text; they are
//         single-clause fragments (substrings of 53 and 3 cards respectively).
//     So do NOT cite this block as card-derived: only `DRAIN_CLERIC` would
//     survive that claim, and it is not why any of the four is here.
//
// (2) CARD PROVENANCE — `TERRAMORPHIC` and `DEATHRITE_SHAMAN` (below) ARE their
//     named printing's complete Oracle text, verified byte-for-byte against
//     MTGJSON. That matters for those two specifically: they are the rows'
//     subject matter, and a paraphrase can take a different parser branch and go
//     green while the real card stays broken.

/// vanilla, so this seat surrenders its window over a recursion that could not
/// have interfered. That is the gate's shape: it reads the ORIGIN, not the
/// returned card, so it is uniform over what the graveyard happens to hold. Per
/// the module's §2 that is the direction that costs efficacy rather than games,
/// and it is the same trade the `Hand` destination gate already made. MEASURED on
