//! Regression test for GitHub issue #751 — Ark of Hunger / Tablet of Discovery
//! ("{T}: Mill a card. You may play that card this turn.").
//!
//! CR 701.17d: When a mill effect grants permission to play "that card", the
//! permission applies to the milled card — which lives in the GRAVEYARD
//! (CR 701.17a/c, a public zone), not in exile. The parser emits
//! `Mill (→ Graveyard)` chained to `GrantCastingPermission { PlayFromExile,
//! TrackedSet 0 }`, so the grant lands on a graveyard object. Before the fix
//! every `PlayFromExile` consult site hard-gated on `Zone::Exile`, so the
//! milled card carried a live-but-never-consulted permission and was reported
//! "not in a castable zone".
//!
//! The fix makes the three object-tagged `PlayFromExile` consult sites
//! zone-aware (exile OR graveyard, lands excluded from the cast path per
//! CR 305.1). The battlefield-static exile-cast path (Maralen / The Matrix of
//! Time) stays exile-only by rule (CR 113.6b), which the Advanced
//! Reconstruction case below asserts.
