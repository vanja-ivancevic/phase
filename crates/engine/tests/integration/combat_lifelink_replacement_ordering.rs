//! CR 616.1 + CR 510.2 + CR 702.15b — a simultaneous combat-damage batch may
//! park on a lifelink life-gain ordering choice and must resume without losing
//! the gain, the rest of the batch, or CR 603.3b trigger simultaneity.
//!
//! The defect: `apply_combat_damage` called `apply_life_gain`, and when two or
//! more co-applicable life-gain replacements made the CR 616.1 ordering
//! material, that call returned `Err(ReplacementDeferred::ReplacementChoice)`
//! having applied NOTHING. The old code rolled `waiting_for` back and dropped
//! 100% of that source's gain — plus every later lifelink source in the same
//! batch — on the false premise that CR 510.2 forbids combat pausing. CR 510.2
//! forbids *casting spells and activating abilities* between combat damage
//! being assigned and dealt; a CR 616.1 choice is neither.
//!
//! This is a MECHANIC class, not a card class: the fix keys on the typed
//! `ReplacementDeferred` outcome, so it covers every board where
//! `replacement_ordering_is_material` is true for a `ProposedEvent::LifeGain`
//! raised from combat damage — the "gain twice that much life instead" family
//! (Rhox Faithmender, Boon Reflection, Alhammarret's Archive) crossed with the
//! "that much life plus N instead" family (Leyline of Hope, Cleric Class L2),
//! crossed with the whole lifelink pool.
//!
//! `Multiply{2}` and `Offset{+1}` deliberately do not commute
//! (2(n+1) != 2n+1), which is exactly what makes `replacement_ordering_is_material`
//! return true and forces a real player choice (CR 616.1).
