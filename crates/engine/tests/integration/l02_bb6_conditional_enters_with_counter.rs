//! L02 BB6 — enters-with-counter gated by a condition (2 Standard cards).
//!
//! Cards (Oracle text verified verbatim vs Scryfall / `data/card-data.json`):
//!   * Freestrider Commando (OTJ 155, {2}{G} 3/3 Centaur Mercenary) — the
//!     enters-with-counters replacement is gated on "if it wasn't cast or no mana
//!     was spent to cast it" → a single `ManaSpentToCast == 0` leaf that flows
//!     through the existing `extract_enters_with_only_if_suffix` →
//!     `replacement_condition_from_static` (QuantityComparison → OnlyIfQuantity)
//!     pipeline (Blacksnag Buzzard precedent).
//!   * Undead Sprinter (DSK 121, {B}{R} 2/2 Zombie) — a self-granting graveyard
//!     cast permission gated on "if a non-Zombie creature died this turn", with a
//!     linked "If you do, this creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it" rider.
//!
//! Parse tests drive `parse_oracle_text` / the single condition authority
//! `parse_inner_condition`; runtime tests drive the real cast pipeline
//! (`GameRunner::cast(..).resolve()`). Counter assertions check PLACEMENT only.
//!
//! FOLLOW-UP (out of BB6's zero-variant scope): Freestrider's
//! `mana_spent_to_cast_amount` is not cleared in `reset_for_battlefield_entry`
//! (a codebase-wide field-hygiene gap shared with Lavinia/Satoru). A Freestrider
//! hard-cast-and-countered earlier this game and later reanimated as the SAME
//! object reads a stale nonzero amount, so the `== 0` leaf wrongly suppresses the
//! counters. The single-leaf representation is rules-correct for every realistic
//! Standard path (hard-cast / Plot / reanimate-a-fresh-object); the true fix
//! needs `ReplacementCondition::Or` (a `Not(WasCast)` disjunct over the
//! per-entry-reset `cast_from_zone`), which is absent. Not tested here.
