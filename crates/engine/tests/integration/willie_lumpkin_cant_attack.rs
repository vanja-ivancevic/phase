//! MSH Wave 6: Willie Lumpkin, Postman — "Whenever Willie Lumpkin deals combat
//! damage to an opponent, you draw a card and that player may draw a card. If
//! they do, that player can't attack you or permanents you control during their
//! next turn."
//!
//! The trailing "that player can't attack you or permanents you control during
//! their next turn" was a parser `Effect::Unimplemented { name: "can't" }` leaf.
//! This suite locks in:
//!   1. PARSE: the trigger sub-chain leaf lowers to
//!      `Effect::AddRestriction { ProhibitActivity { Attack { PlayerOrPermanents },
//!      ParentTargetedPlayer } }`, NOT `Unimplemented`.
//!   2. RUNTIME: the new player-scoped declare-attackers gate rejects the
//!      restricted player's attacks against the protected player, their
//!      planeswalker, AND their battle (the `PlayerOrPermanents` Battle arm),
//!      while a third (unrestricted) player may attack freely.
//!   3. EXPIRY: the restriction anchors on the RESTRICTED player's next turn.
//!
//! CR 508.1c: attack restrictions checked at declare-attackers. CR 508.5: the
//! defended planeswalker/battle compares on controller. CR 310.5: battles are
//! attackable permanents (the `PlayerOrPermanents` distinction from
//! `PlayerOrPlaneswalker`). CR 514.2 + CR 500.7: next-turn expiry.
