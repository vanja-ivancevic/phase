//! #3223 — "This ability costs {N} less to activate if [condition]" on
//! non-equip activated abilities.
//!
//! Root cause (fixed): `strip_suffix_conditional` peeled the trailing
//! "if [condition]" off the self cost-reduction sentence UPSTREAM, leaving the
//! chained `Unimplemented` node's description as the bare
//! "This ability costs {N} less to activate" — which `try_parse_cost_reduction`
//! (whose conditional arm requires the full "… if [condition]" sentence) could
//! not match. The fix declines that peel for self cost-reduction sentences (via
//! `is_self_cost_reduction_prefix`) so the whole sentence reaches the existing
//! conditional arm, which re-homes the condition into `CostReduction.condition`.
//!
//! CR 601.2f: cost reductions are folded into the total cost at
//! cost-determination time. CR 602.2b: an activated ability's activation cost is
//! the analog of a spell's mana cost.
//!
//! These tests drive the real `parse_oracle_text` entry point with the verbatim
//! Oracle text from `data/mtgjson/AtomicCards.json`. They are DISCRIMINATING:
//! each asserts the dropped clause is now captured (and that no `Unimplemented`
//! node carrying the cost-reduction text survives), so they fail if the fix is
//! reverted. The negative tests enforce coverage-honesty: cards whose condition
//! the parser does not model MUST stay a loud gap (no silent mis-parse).
