//! CR 608.2d: the magnitude of an "up to N" draw is a resolution-time choice
//! made by the drawing player — every count in `0..=N` must be reachable.
//!
//! Reported against Arcane Denial, whose real Oracle text (verified against
//! `data/mtgjson/AtomicCards.json`) reads:
//!
//! > Counter target spell. Its controller may draw up to two cards at the
//! > beginning of the next turn's upkeep.
//! > You draw a card at the beginning of the next turn's upkeep.
//!
//! The parse was already correct — the count lowered to
//! `UpTo { max: Fixed { value: 2 } }`. The defect was entirely below the parser:
//! `draw::resolve` read the count through `resolve_quantity_with_targets`, the
//! TRANSPARENT resolver, and `game/quantity.rs` folds `UpTo { max }` to `max`.
//! So no choice was ever opened and the draw silently resolved at the upper
//! bound: Arcane Denial always drew exactly two, with both 0 and 1 unreachable.
//!
//! These tests are deliberately pitched at the BUILDING BLOCK — a bare
//! `Effect::Draw { count: UpTo { .. } }` resolving through the production cast
//! pipeline — rather than replaying one card, because the bug belongs to every
//! "up to N" draw. A parser-level shape test cannot see this defect at all: the
//! AST was already right.
