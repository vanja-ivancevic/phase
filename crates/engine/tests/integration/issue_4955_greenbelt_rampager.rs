//! Regression for issue #4955: Greenbelt Rampager's ETB —
//! "When this creature enters, pay {E}{E} (two energy counters). If you
//! can't, return this creature to its owner's hand and you get {E}." — always
//! bounced the creature back to its owner's hand, even when the controller
//! had 2+ energy and actually paid the cost.
//!
//! Root cause (CR 608.2c + CR 118.1 + CR 118.3): the generic "if you can't"
//! rider lowers to `AbilityCondition::Not { ZoneChangedThisWay { Any } }` — a
//! proxy that reads `state.last_zone_changed_ids`, which is populated only by
//! effects that move an object between zones (search/exile/sacrifice/…).
//! `Effect::PayCost` (the "pay {E}{E}" instruction) deducts energy from the
//! player's pool and moves no object anywhere, so the zone-change ledger
//! stayed empty regardless of whether the payment actually succeeded —
//! `Not { ZoneChangedThisWay { Any } }` was therefore true UNCONDITIONALLY,
//! firing the bounce rider every time regardless of affordability.
//!
//! Fix: `rewrite_cant_rider_for_non_zone_change_parent`
//! (`crates/engine/src/parser/oracle_effect/mod.rs`) — already carved out for
//! the analogous `Effect::TurnFaceUp` class (Etrata, Deadly Fugitive: "Turn
//! this creature face up. If you can't, exile it …") — now also recognizes
//! `Effect::PayCost` as a zone-change-ledger-invisible parent and rewrites the
//! rider to `Not { OptionalEffectPerformed }`. That signal is fed by the
//! resolution-time cost-payment authority's `cost_payment_failed_flag`
//! (`game::effects::pay::resolve` / `resolve_ability_cost_payment`), which
//! correctly distinguishes a paid {E}{E} from an unpaid one — and, via the
//! mandatory-rider seed in `resolve_ability_chain`
//! (`game::effects::mod::mandatory_parent_effect_performed` falls through to
//! its `_ => true` default for `PayCost`, so the seed reduces to exactly
//! `!cost_payment_failed_flag`), sets `optional_effect_performed` iff the
//! payment succeeded.
//!
//! Both tests drive the real casting + ETB-trigger pipeline against the
//! verified Oracle text (Scryfall, 2026-07-14): {G} Elephant, 3/4.

// both). This section drives a REAL stolen/reanimated-permanent scenario
// through the production cast + ETB pipeline: Greenbelt Rampager starts in
// P0's graveyard (P0 is its owner throughout), and P1 reanimates it with a
// real Oracle-text-parsed spell — "Put target creature card from a graveyard
// onto the battlefield under your control." (the first sentence of
// Necromantic Summons, verified real Oracle text) — which lowers to
// `Effect::ChangeZone { enters_under: Some(ControllerRef::You), .. }` (CR
// 110.2a). That makes P1 the CONTROLLER of an object P0 still OWNS the moment
// it enters, exactly the fixture the review asked for, driven through the
// real production resolver (`change_zone::resolve` -> real ETB trigger scan
// -> real `pay::resolve`), not a hand-built synthetic AST.
//
// CR 109.5: "you"/"your" in an ability always means that ability's
// controller. Greenbelt Rampager's ETB ability is controlled by whoever
// controls Greenbelt Rampager when it enters (CR 603.3d) — P1 here — so both
// the "{E}{E}" cost and the "you get {E}" reward must bind to P1, never P0.
// The bounce destination ("return this creature to its OWNER's hand") is the
// one explicitly owner-relative phrase in the Oracle text and must go to P0
// regardless of who controls it.
