//! The Codie, Vociferous Codex turn-14 `EffectZoneChoice` wedge — a board that
//! reached `legal_actions_full == 0` and could never be advanced again.
//!
//! Codie's mana ability ends "**Put each other card exiled this way on the
//! bottom of your library in a random order**", parsed as `PutAtLibraryPosition
//! { position: Bottom, target: And [ Typed{Card,[Another]}, ExiledBySource ] }`.
//! Its members are therefore in `Zone::Exile`, but the producer hardcoded
//! `zone: Zone::Library` on the prompt, and the delivery guard admitted
//! `PutAtLibraryPosition` members only from `Hand | Library`. Every candidate
//! was refused, so the prompt offered zero legal actions and the game wedged
//! permanently.
//!
//! The fix has **two independent halves**, and this module is written to keep
//! both alive:
//!
//! * **Part 1 (`engine_resolution_choices.rs`) rescues already-wedged saves.**
//!   `into_game_state` restores a persisted prompt verbatim, so a save written
//!   by the old producer still arrives claiming `zone: Library` over
//!   Exile-resident members. No producer fix can reach it. Rows A1 and A2 pin
//!   this half.
//! * **Part 2 (`effects/put_on_top.rs`) prevents future wedges** by deriving the
//!   prompt's zone from the filter instead of asserting `Library`. Rows here do
//!   not discriminate on it — see the module-level note on A2.
//!
//! Row A3 pins the *bound*: the relocation exemption must not swallow
//! `Battlefield` or `Stack`. Row A4 pins that it did not become universal
//! across effect kinds.
//!
//! # Fixture provenance
//!
//! `../fixtures/codie_turn14.json.gz` is derived, not captured:
