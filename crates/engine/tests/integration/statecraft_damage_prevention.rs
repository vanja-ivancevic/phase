///      (~line 13627, "CR 303.4a: An Aura spell requires a target defined by
///      its enchant ability") only generates a target slot from the object's
///      `Keyword::Enchant` filter when `card_types.subtypes` contains
///      `"Aura"`. Omit it and the branch never runs, so the spell resolves
///      with no target chosen and nothing attached — `attached_to` stays
///      `None` while the object stays on the battlefield undisturbed (no SBA
///      fires, confirmed by removing this call in isolation: no sweep, just
///      a silently-unattached shield doing nothing). This is unrelated to
///      CR 704.5m/704.5p SBA sweeps — it's a cast-time target-generation gate.
///   2. `from_oracle_text_with_keywords(&["enchant"], ...)` — bare-FromStr
///      keyword inference can't extract `Keyword::Enchant` from the
///      space-form "Enchant creature" line (see
///      `metamorphic_alteration.rs`'s `stage_metamorphic`). With the subtype
///      present but no `Keyword::Enchant`, the same casting.rs branch DOES
///      run (subtype check passes) but finds no Enchant filter to build a
///      slot from, so the Aura again resolves with nothing attached — this
///      time `is_aura` at the SBA layer is genuinely true, so CR 704.5m's
///      orphan-Aura branch (`check_unattached_auras`, `sba.rs:~1301`, which
