//! Issue #6942: a `DigChoice` whose filter (or a short library) leaves fewer
//! selectable cards than `keep_count` must accept the largest possible
//! selection, not reject every selection.
//!
//! CR 609.3 ("If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as
//! much as possible") and CR 101.3 ("Any part of an instruction that's
//! impossible to perform is ignored"). Before the fix, the exact-cardinality
//! gate in `engine_resolution_choices.rs` demanded `keep_count` ids while
//! `validate_dig_selection` required every kept id to be in `selectable_cards`
//! — so when `selectable_cards.len() < keep_count` the two rules had NO common
//! solution and every controller (AI, human, multiplayer server) softlocked.
//!
//! The candidate enumerator (`ai_support/candidates.rs`) and
//! `cheap_reject_candidate` (`ai_support/mod.rs`) already clamped to
//! `keep_count.min(selectable_cards.len())`; the resolution handler was the
//! outlier.
