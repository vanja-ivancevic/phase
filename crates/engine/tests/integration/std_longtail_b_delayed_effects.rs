//! Standard long-tail batch B — delayed-trigger / timing / damage-anaphor
//! parser arms, exercised through the production `apply()` pipeline.
//!
//! Each test drives the parsed ability/trigger through real game actions
//! (activation, attack declaration, phase advance) and asserts an observable
//! game-state change that FLIPS if the corresponding parser arm is reverted.
//!
//! Cards covered:
//! - All-Out Assault — "When you next attack this turn, untap each creature you
//!   control" delayed `WhenNextEvent{YouAttack}` one-shot trigger.
//! - Fortune, Loyal Steed — "at end of combat" delayed-trigger prefix on an
//!   attack trigger body (`AtNextPhase{EndCombat}`).
//! - Fear of Burning Alive — "deals that amount of damage to target creature
//!   that player controls" (EventContextAmount + TriggeringPlayer binding).
//! - Y'shtola Rhul — additional end step gated by "first end step of the turn"
//!   (`FirstEndStepOfTurn`) loop guard.
