//! Issue #8024 reporter captures: two Commander boards that reached a priority
//! window still carrying a terminal resolution carrier, so the next turn advance
//! tripped the `start_next_turn` precondition at `game/turns.rs`.
//!
//! Both captures are the *exact engine-owned residue* shapes the restore
//! boundary now retires before it publishes a priority window, and they are the
//! two shapes the already-tracked `mycoloth_devour_drain_strand.rs` captures do
//! NOT cover: those two carry an ownerless `DrainStatus::Dispatching` resident,
//! while these two carry no live drain at all.
//!
//! | capture | residue |
//! |---|---|
//! | turn 26 | one `SpellResolution` frame over a completed `Spell` carrier — the bare permanent-spell epilogue |
//! | turn 10 | an EMPTY `PostReplacement` frame under a `ChangeZone` frame holding only a `devour_eligible_snapshot` |
//!
//! # Why the reporters' builds panicked and origin/main alone does not
//!
//! The live action boundary gained the same two repairs first — `#8019`
//! (`d070dca1f0`, Devour, 2026-08-28T18:31Z) and `#8031` (`ff4e09df6f`, bare
//! spell resolution, 2026-08-29T00:20Z). Both captures predate the build that
//! carried them (`v0.66.0` / `4b85b52`, 2026-08-28T20:53Z, which contains the
//! first and not the second), so on the reporters' builds nothing retired the
//! carrier and `start_next_turn` asserted.
//!
//! What those two PRs did NOT do is settle the residue at the *persistence*
//! boundary: a decode still PUBLISHED the unsettled window and relied on some
//! later `apply` to repair it. These rows pin the restore-boundary contract
//! instead, which is the one `start_next_turn` actually depends on.
//!
//! # Fixture provenance
//!
//! Reporter attachments from the issue-#8024 Discord threads. The ~21 MB raw
//! members are deliberately NOT tracked; only the derived `.json.gz` are.
