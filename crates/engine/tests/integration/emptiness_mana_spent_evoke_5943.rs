//! Regression tests for issue #5943: Emptiness's "if {W}{W}/{B}{B} was spent
//! to cast it" ETB riders must survive until the CR 603.4 intervening-if
//! re-check at resolution.
//!
//! Root cause: `clear_post_collection_transients` (triggers.rs) wiped
//! `colors_spent_to_cast` on ALL objects after every trigger-collection pass,
//! so by the time the conditional ETB trigger resolved (or was even collected,
//! after the cast-event collection pass), the per-color tally was gone and the
//! rider silently did nothing. The fix preserves the tally for objects on the
//! Battlefield or Stack (mirroring `cast_from_zone`), clears all five
//! cast-payment stamps for objects in every other zone (a countered/fizzled
//! spell loses its payment record at the next collection pass) and at
//! battlefield exit via `GameObject::clear_cast_payment_stamps` (CR 400.7),
//! and resets the stamps on every spell-copy birth (CR 707.10 / CR 707.12).
//!
//! Dropped row (plan R7b, prepared-copy sibling): `prepare.rs`'s exile-copy
//! is out of the stack-copy-birth class — a later cast of the prepared copy
//! re-stamps through the normal `casting.rs` payment blocks (see the
//! `GameObject::clear_cast_payment_stamps` doc) — and a prepare-class fixture
//! is not cheaply constructible here.
