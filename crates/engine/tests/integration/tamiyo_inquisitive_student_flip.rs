//! Runtime regression for GitHub issue #4543 — Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student's
//! "draw your third card" transform-flip trigger.
//!
//! Front-face Oracle: "When you draw your third card in a turn, exile Tamiyo,
//! then return her to the battlefield transformed under her owner's control."
//!
//! The reported bug was runtime-visible: when the controller drew their third
//! card, Tamiyo exiled herself but never returned — she was stranded in exile.
//! Root cause was a parser anaphor mis-binding. Clause 1 ("exile Tamiyo")
//! correctly names the source via `~` → `SelfRef`, but clause 2's bare "her"
//! ("return her ... transformed") bound to `TriggeringSource`. The trigger
//! subject is the player ("you draw ..."), so the `CardDrawn` event carries no
//! resolvable source object — `TriggeringSource` resolved to nothing and the
//! return moved nothing. The SelfRef-anaphor rewrite that fixes this class was
//! previously gated on a *typed* trigger subject (Ajani's "one or more Cats
//! die"); the fix extends it to the transform-flip-from-exile class.
//!
//! This drives the REAL parse → draw-event → trigger → stack → zone-change
//! pipeline: Tamiyo is synthesized from Oracle text (so the trigger reflects
//! current parser source, not a stored/stale card-data AST), three draws are
//! resolved through the production `draw::resolve` seam, and the third queues
//! and resolves the trigger. The discriminating assertion is that Tamiyo is
//! back on the battlefield — with the fix reverted she stays in exile.
//!
//! CR 608.2c: "read the whole text ... apply the rules of English" — the
//! anaphor "her" binds to the named antecedent in the preceding clause.
//! CR 712.14a: a double-faced card put onto the battlefield transformed enters
//! with its back face up.
//! CR 603.2: the third-draw trigger fires only on the third draw of the turn.
