//! The Will cycle's coordinated graveyard permission, END TO END.
//!
//! **What this suite is for.** The parser half of this class was measured green
//! by the coverage gate while delivering NOTHING to a player: the resolved
//! `Effect::CastFromZone` is not a channel any land-permission consumer reads, so
//! `casting::graveyard_lands_playable_by_permission` returned `[]` after
//! resolving the real Oracle text. Every row here therefore RESOLVES the card and
//! asks the production consumer what a player may actually do — no row asserts
//! parse shape alone, and no row hand-installs a permission.
//!
//! **The class.** "Until end of turn, you may play lands and cast spells from
//! your graveyard" (Yawgmoth's Will, Gaea's Will, Magus of the Will) is ONE
//! permission naming two actions (CR 116.2a: playing a land is a special action;
//! CR 601.2a: casting).
//!
//! **CR 611.2c is the design constraint, not a footnote.** A resolution-created
//! continuous effect that does not modify characteristics "modifies the rules of
//! the game, so it can affect objects that weren't affected when that continuous
//! effect began." That is why `d2` exists: a card milled AFTER the spell resolved
//! must still be covered. The card itself proves the reading — its second
//! sentence ("If a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn,
//! exile that card instead") is only meaningful if the first sentence reaches
//! cards that arrive later.
//!
//! **Stack size.** `parse_oracle_text` overflows the default 8 MB test stack and
//! prints a convincing PARTIAL negative on the way down rather than failing, so
//! every body that parses runs on 256 MB via `on_big_stack`.
