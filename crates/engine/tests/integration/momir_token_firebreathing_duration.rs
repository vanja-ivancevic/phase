//! BUG B repro (HIGH FIDELITY): a Momir token COPY of a REAL transform back
//! face (`Insectile Aberration`) carrying "{1}: This creature gets +1/+0 until
//! end of turn" must NOT accumulate power across turns.
//!
//! The user insists the pump "stacks every turn" — a CROSS-TURN base-P/T creep
//! claim. The first investigation used a synthetic `Cost{3}` creature face and
//! a single `execute_cleanup` call, which cannot detect cross-turn creep. This
//! file closes three fidelity gaps:
//!
//!   1. Drives the REAL multi-phase turn boundary through `GameRunner`
//!      (PassPriority + the actual phase machinery, incl. the `Phase::Cleanup`
//!      arm of `advance_phase` at turns.rs:2016-2018), NOT a direct
//!      `execute_cleanup` call.
//!   2. Runs TWO consecutive turns for the SAME controller (turn N -> N+2),
//!      checking the token's BASE power is still its printed 3, never 4.
//!   3. Uses the REAL `Insectile Aberration` transform back face from the
//!      MTGJSON test fixture (a `layout: transform`, 3/2 creature), built into
//!      a Momir token via `CreateTokenCopyFromPool`, so the
//!      transform/copy/`is_token` base-P/T storage path is exercised. The
//!      firebreathing ability is attached to that real face (the printed back
//!      face has no firebreathing).
//!
//!      The printed face carries `ManaCost::NoCost`, which
//!      `create_token_copy_from_pool::face_is_eligible` correctly refuses to
//!      draw (CR 202.3b — a back face is not a separately castable creature
//!      card; that guard has its own test in
//!      `momir_pool_excludes_transform_back_faces`). So this test stamps an
//!      explicit mana cost on the face purely to make it reachable through the
//!      real draw path. Everything under test here — the real transform face,
//!      its base 3/2, the copy pipeline, and the turn machinery — is
//!      unaffected by that cost.
//!
//! CR 611.2a: a continuous effect from a resolved ability with "until end of
//! turn" lasts until the cleanup step.
//! CR 514.2: "until end of turn" effects end during the cleanup step.
//! CR 707.2: a copy uses the copiable values (incl. abilities) of the copied
//! object.
