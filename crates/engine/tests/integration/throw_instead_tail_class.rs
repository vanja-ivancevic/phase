//! Group C — Throw from the Saddle and the "X instead if Z. Then Y." class
//! (S01 reflexive-if completion).
//!
//! Four coordinated parser fixes plus one resolver fix make a trailing,
//! independent clause printed AFTER a `ConditionInstead` override run in BOTH
//! branches (CR 608.2c — read the whole text; the "instead" replaces only the
//! prior sentence):
//!   - FIX A  (`parser/oracle.rs`): defer an intra-chain "… instead if <cond>.
//!     <trailing clause>" line to the chunk parser instead of swallowing it.
//!   - FIX A' (`parser/oracle_effect/lower.rs`): rebind the instead-override
//!     "Put a +1/+1 counter on it" `SelfRef` → `ParentTarget` (the chosen base
//!     target).
//!   - FIX C  (`parser/oracle_effect/lower.rs`): rebind the nested one-sided-fight
//!     damage tail to the Ambuscade anaphor (`Power{Anaphoric}` +
//!     `DamageSource::Target`).
//!   - RESOLVER (`game/effects/mod.rs`): in the `ConditionInstead` not-swap arm,
//!     run the override's trailing `SequentialSibling` tail with the swap path's
//!     one-sided-fight target contract, when `else_ability` is absent.
//!
//! Every behavioral test drives the real cast pipeline (`GameRunner::cast(...)
//! .resolve()`), so it exercises parser + resolver end-to-end and fails if the
//! corresponding fix is reverted.
//!
//! MEASURED RUNTIME STRUCTURE (the key subtlety): the resolver fix's
//! behavior-change set is exactly the four cards whose independent tail becomes a
//! NESTED `SequentialSibling` under the `ConditionInstead` override AT RUNTIME:
//! Throw from the Saddle (DealDamage tail), Evil's Thrall (Untap+haste tail),
//! Take the Fall and That's Rough Buddy (Draw tail). For the latter two, "Draw a
//! card." prints on a SEPARATE LINE, so the RAW `parse_oracle_text` yields it as
//! a separate top-level `ability[1]`; but `synthesize_all` (run by
//! `from_oracle_text` and the card-data pipeline) FOLDS that ability into
//! `ability[0]`'s deepest sub — the override — as a `Draw[SequentialSibling]`
//! tail. So at runtime all four carry the nested tail the resolver fix runs.
//! Measured + revert-probed: disabling the resolver `else if` branch drops the
//! Draw on Take the Fall / That's Rough Buddy as well as the damage/untap on
//! Throw / Evil's Thrall. (FIX A is still required for the latter two: without it
//! the line-level swallow loses the Draw clause before synthesis can fold it.)
