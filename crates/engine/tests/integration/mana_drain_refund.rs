//! End-to-end integration test for Mana Drain's delayed-trigger refund.
//!
//! Verifies the full chain: parse → counter → snapshot → advance phase →
//! fire → mana in pool. Pre-fix, Mana Drain's "At the beginning of your
//! next main phase, add {C} equal to that spell's mana value" parsed as
//! `Effect::Unimplemented { name: "at" }` and the refund silently no-opped.
//! Post-fix, the prefix-position parser arm + snapshot walker combine to
//! refund colorless mana equal to the countered spell's mana value at the
//! controller's next PreCombatMain.
