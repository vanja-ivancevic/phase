//! Issue #5902: Heart-Shaped Herb must prevent 1 damage from each opponent-
//! controlled source dealt to you, and must not affect damage from your own
//! sources. This is a discriminating engine scenario driving the real
//! `deal_damage::resolve` pipeline, not just parsing.
//!
//! Before this fix, "prevent N of that damage" (no "all" / "all but" / "the
//! next" qualifier) matched none of `parse_damage_prevention_replacement`'s
//! amount branches, so the whole static ability failed to parse into a
//! `ReplacementDefinition` at all — the reported symptom was that Heart-
//! Shaped Herb "isn't affecting it at all".
//!
//! Per the maintainer's CR review (add-engine-variant Stage 1 =
//! `REFUSE_WITH_EXISTING_SLOT`), the fix reuses the existing shared
//! per-event damage-subtraction authority — the `Minus` applier arm — under
//! its typed prevention provenance `DamageModification::PreventionMinus
//! { value: N }` on a `DamageDone` replacement, the same continuous,
//! non-consumed representation CR 702.64 Absorb already synthesizes
//! (`database::synthesis::build_absorb_replacement`) — instead of a new
//! `PreventionAmount` variant. Only the prevention provenance emits the
//! `DamagePrevented` bookkeeping the prevention shields emit; plain
//! arithmetic `Minus` (Benevolent Unicorn) does not.
//!
//! CR 615.1a (prevention shield) + CR 702.64b (continuous, non-depleting) +
//! CR 609.7b (controller-scoped source restriction).
