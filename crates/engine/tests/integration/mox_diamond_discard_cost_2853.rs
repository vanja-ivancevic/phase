//! Mox Diamond — the as-enters "you may discard a land card instead" cost must
//! actually discard a land when accepted, and only then does the artifact enter.
//!
//! Regression for issue #2853: the `MayCost { Discard }` replacement parsed
//! correctly (accept/decline branches present), but the runtime accept path
//! routed the discard through `pay_ability_cost` in *activation* scope. The
//! `Discard { FromHand, Chosen }` shape is only paid in *resolution* scope; in
//! activation scope it fell through to the interactive-pass-through arm and
//! returned `Paid` as a silent no-op. The land was never discarded, yet the
//! artifact still entered (the cost was skipped). These tests drive the real
//! parsed replacement through the as-enters pipeline and assert the land is
//! discarded on accept, kept on decline, and that an unpayable accept routes
//! the artifact to the graveyard.
//!
//! CR 614.12a / CR 614.12: a declined/unpayable alternative routes to the
//! owner's graveyard; CR 701.9a: discarding moves a card from hand to graveyard.
