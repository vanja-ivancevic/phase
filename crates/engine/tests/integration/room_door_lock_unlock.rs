//! Stage 1 runtime coverage for the Rooms lock/unlock-door effect
//! (`Effect::SetRoomDoorLock`, CR 709.5f-j).
//!
//! These tests drive the real production resolution path
//! (`resolve_ability_chain` → `set_room_door_lock::resolve`) and the real
//! interactive-choice submission path (`apply_as_current` →
//! `engine_resolution_choices::handle_resolution_choice`). The effect is
//! constructed programmatically — the Oracle-text parser arm is Stage 2 and is
//! deliberately NOT exercised here.
//!
//! Each test names a revert-failing assertion in its doc comment.
