//! GameRunner integration regression for Veteran Bodyguard's tap-gated damage
//! redirection (CR 604.2 + CR 614.9 + CR 509.1h).
//!
//! Oracle text under test (verbatim, Scryfall-verified):
//!   "As long as this creature is untapped, all damage that would be dealt to
//!    you by unblocked creatures is dealt to this creature instead."
//!
//! Two cases:
//!  1. Untapped — the redirect fires: an unblocked attacker's damage lands on
//!     Veteran Bodyguard instead of the defending player.
//!  2. Tapped — the redirect does NOT fire: the same unblocked attacker's
//!     damage lands on the defending player normally.
//!
//! The Bodyguard is controlled by the defending player (P1); P0 (the active
//! player) attacks P1 with a 3/3, so "you" in the Oracle text — the Bodyguard's
//! controller, P1 — is the damaged player whose damage redirects to itself.
