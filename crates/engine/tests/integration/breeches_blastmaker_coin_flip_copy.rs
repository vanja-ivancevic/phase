//! Breeches, the Blastmaker — "Whenever you cast your second spell each turn,

//! copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy. When you lose the
//! flip, Breeches deals damage equal to that spell's mana value to any target."
//!
//! CR 603.12: the "When you win/lose the flip, [effect]" templating is a
//! *reflexive triggered ability*, NOT Krark's inline "If you win/lose the flip"
//! wording (CR 705). A reflexive trigger follows delayed-triggered-ability rules
//! (CR 603.3 / CR 603.7): its branch effect is put on the stack and resolves with
//! its own priority window, NOT inline during the flip's own resolution.
//!
//! The parser lowers each "When you win/lose the flip" clause to an
//! `Effect::CreateDelayedTrigger` whose embedded `TriggerMode::FlippedCoin`
//! trigger (filtered by `coin_flip_result`) fires on the `CoinFlipped` event
//! emitted earlier in the flip's resolution. The existing `check_delayed_triggers`
//! path then puts that branch on the stack as its own object. These tests drive
//! the genuine resolution pipeline and assert the on-stack ordering, not just the
//! parsed AST shape.
