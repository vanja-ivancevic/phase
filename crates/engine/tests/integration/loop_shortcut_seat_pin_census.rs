//! **Row R2-b — the PROVENANCE census.** CR 601.2c vs CR 115.10a: a seat pin's SPELLING is its
//! provenance, so the walked source's `TargetPin::Player` occurrences are pinned per file and
//! each is classified — a TARGET-class producer constructing one is the violation that
//! classification catches.
//!
//! # Why a census and not a validator narrowing
//!
//! The alternative — teaching `validate_pins` / `declaration_conforms` to REJECT a
//! `TargetPin::Player` on a player-valued `Targets` slot — is refused for a measured reason.
//! `game::engine`'s `a_shrouded_player_pin_is_still_published_by_the_offer_builder` carries the
//! revert-probe *"route `resolve_target`'s `TargetPin::Player` arm through
//! `targeting::player_is_legal_target` ⇒ both assertions FAIL"*: that narrowing restores the
//! CR 115.10a over-veto, where a merely CHOSEN player (a CR 701.34a proliferate choice) is
//! refused for a targeting-only exclusion it is not subject to. It would also put a rejection
//! rule on a WIRE-VISIBLE type in order to stop a FUTURE producer from picking the wrong
//! spelling. A source census stops the same thing at no wire-compatibility cost, which is what
//! this file is.
//!
//! # What it asserts, in three conjuncts
//!
//! 1. **The `TargetPin::Player` occurrences the walk finds are pinned per file, by identity
//!    and multiplicity.** The instrument counts constructions and match arms alike, so what
//!    separates them is the disposition each site carries below. The two producers are
//!    named individually — `game::engine::record_trigger_target_answer` (the engine's own
//!    CR 601.2c announcement journal) and
//!    `game::interaction::materialize_loop_shortcut_response` (the human ingress of the same
//!    point kind). Naming them individually is the point: a census asserting only a TOTAL
//!    production count would stay green with EITHER producer reverted, since a revert removes
//!    a ranked construction and adds a `TargetPin::Player` one, leaving the total unchanged.
//! 2. **The CHOICE-class and pass-through sites are still PRESENT and classified.** A census
//!    that counts zero of everything is vacuous, so every surviving production site is
//!    enumerated with its disposition and the list is pinned exactly.
//! 3. **Both producers do construct the ranked spelling**, keyed to the same instrument — the
//!    two needles returning DIFFERENT per-file answers over the same walk, on the same files,
//!    is what makes conjunct 1's answer a measurement rather than a broken grep.
//!
//! # Anti-vacuity: the instrument is validated before it is trusted
//!
//! [`the_seat_pin_census_instrument_reports_both_answers_on_planted_input`] feeds the classifier
//! a synthetic source carrying BOTH spellings inside and outside a `#[cfg(test)]` scope and
//! requires it to separate them. Without that arm, a needle that silently matched nothing would
//! report conjunct 1 as a pass.
//!
//! The `#[cfg(test)]` scope classifier and the directory walk are REUSED from
//! [`super::loop_shortcut_offer_writer_census`] rather than re-derived: that file records a
//! measured defect in the naive "nearest preceding attribute" rule, and a second copy of the
//! rule is a second place for it to be got wrong.

    // Multiplicity carries the load instead — a new construction anywhere THE WALK VISITS in

    // moves the compared value. That includes a further `engine.rs` hit from reverting

    // including one written onto a line that already carries a construction, since the count is
    // per OCCURRENCE.
    // Do NOT relax `files` to a de-duplicated set on the theory that the text pins cover the

    //   1. this multiset — an occurrence added to or removed from any walked file, including
    //      either producer reverting to the choice-class spelling;
    //   2. the text pins below, on `engine.rs` and on `interaction.rs` — a SUBSTITUTION at a
    //      pinned arm that holds its file's count, and, in `engine.rs`, a change in the two
    //      arms' relative ORDER (relocating arm 0 below arm 1 fails the first text pin with the
    //      count and both texts otherwise unchanged);
    //   3. conjunct 3's per-file `AnnouncementSubject::Seat` count — a substitution that ALSO
    //      preserves both texts (producer reverted AND the positive control dropped) passes both
    //      text pins and is caught only there.
    //
    // LIMITATION, stated as a property rather than a list: every file NOT text-pinned below is
    // pinned by identity and count alone, so swapping one of its occurrences for a DIFFERENT
    // one in the same file leaves this census green. The producer files ARE text-pinned, and
    // even there a RELOCATION passes, because this census pins no `file:line` anywhere, by
    // design. The text pins read TEXT and not grammar, so an occurrence whose text is a pinned
    // arm head's is admitted. A further limit belongs to the needle itself, which no pin
    // reaches: a spelling behind an import alias is matched by neither the count nor the text.

            the `Scheduled(Constant(_))` arm of the SAME match, which also returns 1.\n\
         3. `game/engine.rs` — `apply_action`'s CR 701.34a proliferate arm feeding \
            `record_loop_pin`. A proliferate choice is NOT a target, so this construction is \
            correct and is this census's positive control.\n\

            pinned seat onto the announcement vocabulary and mints no pin.\n\

///    census counted a removed construction as still present, which is exactly the substitution
///    class conjunct 1 exists to catch. MEASURED by revert-probe: restoring
///    `line.matches(needle)` makes this arm fail `left: 1 / right: 0`.
/// 2. INFLATION — one real construction plus a mention of the same spelling in a trailing
///    comment on that same line: 1, not 2. Under the old rule a pure PROSE edit moved the pinned
///    multiset with no code change (revert-probe: `left: 2 / right: 1`).
/// 3. FAIL-CLOSED — a `//` inside a STRING LITERAL preceding a real construction: 1, not 0. A
///    naive `split("//")` truncates there and UNDER-counts, silently dropping a real site;
///    [`code`] leaves a `//` that follows a `"` in the code half, so the miss cannot happen.
