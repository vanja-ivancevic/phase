//! Gimbal, Gremlin Prodigy — end-step trigger that creates a 0/0 Gremlin with
//! X +1/+1 counters, where X is "the number of differently named artifact
//! tokens you control".
//!
//! Bug (pre-fix): the quantity phrase fell through to the
//! `oracle_quantity::parse_quantity_ref_with_context` fallback, which calls
//! `parse_type_phrase_folding_with_ctx` and silently discards the unconsumed
//! remainder. "differently named" was unrecognized, so the result was
//! `QuantityRef::ObjectCount { filter: <empty Typed> }` — a filter that
//! matches every battlefield permanent. With even a handful of permanents in
//! play, the new Gremlin would enter with absurdly oversized stats (the
//! original report: a 24/24 with zero artifact tokens around).
//!
//! Fix: `oracle_nom::quantity::parse_distinct_named_objects` recognizes the
//! "differently named <type-phrase>" template and emits
//! `QuantityRef::ObjectCountDistinct { filter, qualities: [Name] }`. The
//! runtime resolver in `game::quantity` already deduplicates objects by name
//! (CR 201.2 + CR 603.4), so the spawned Gremlin enters with one counter per
//! distinctly-named artifact token its controller controls.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 122.6a: "If an object enters the battlefield with counters on it ...
//!     the object's controller puts those counters on it."
//!   - CR 201.2: a name is an object characteristic.
//!   - CR 513.1a: "At the beginning of [your] end step" triggers fire at the
//!     start of the end step.
//!   - CR 603.4: triggered abilities check their condition on resolution.
