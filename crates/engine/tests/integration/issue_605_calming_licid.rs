//! Issue #605 — a Licid activation must attach the Licid itself to the targeted
//! creature, and the animation must not wear off at end of turn.
//!
//! CR 608.2c + CR 303.4: in "This creature loses this ability and becomes an
//! Aura enchantment with enchant creature. Attach **it** to target creature",
//! the earlier clause animates the ability's own SOURCE into an Aura, so the
//! source is the only object the chain has made attachable — the bare pronoun
//! names it. The parser used to fall through to `TargetFilter::ParentTarget`,
//! which `resolve_object_filter` reads as the ability's chosen target: the
//! enchant recipient. The engine then attached the recipient creature to itself,
//! state-based actions silently undid the nonsense attachment, and the card did
//! nothing at all.
//!
//! CR 611.2a: the animation states no duration, so it lasts until the end of the
//! game. Left unstated it defaulted to `UntilEndOfTurn`, and at cleanup the
//! Licid stopped being an Aura while STAYING attached, permanently locking the
//! victim under "Enchanted creature can't attack". (CR 704.5p is now
//! implemented — `sba::check_illegal_attachment_unattach` — so the reverted
//! Licid also unattaches; the permanent duration remains the CR 611.2a-correct
//! model, and the SBA is a safety net for an illegal state, not a licence to
//! create one.)
//!
//! All 12 Aura-form Licids share this clause, so the assertions are written
//! against the clause shape rather than one card's flavor text. Three sibling
//! classes that route through the same anaphor helper are pinned as
//! non-regressions: the Equipment-ETB class (Embercleave), the chained-referent
//! class (Aura Graft), and the non-attachable-source class (Stonehewer Giant).
//!
//! The second half of this file covers CR 116.2c — "You may pay {W} to end this
//! effect" — across all THIRTEEN cards in that class (the 12 Aura-form Licids
//! plus Flanking Licid), and CR 704.5p as a card-agnostic building block.
