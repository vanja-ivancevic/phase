//! CR 903.13f Commander Draft deck construction (U9), through the production
//! entry point `evaluate_deck_compatibility`.
//!
//! FIXTURE CONVENTION, stated because it is load-bearing. The validator
//! computes the UNION `main_deck.len() + (commander.len() - represented_in_main)`,
//! so it is convention-agnostic per logical deck but NOT agnostic about what a
//! fixture author means by "a 59-card deck". Every fixture here is
//! commanders-INSIDE: `main_deck` carries the complete list and the designated
//! commander is a member of it (CR 903.5a, "including its commander", which
//! CR 903.13f(1) rescales to "at least 60" without disturbing the "including").
//!
//! Writing these the way the existing commander fixtures in `deck_validation.rs`
//! are written — N main cards plus a SEPARATE commander absent from main —
//! would give `total_cards = N + 1` and turn the 59-card rejection into a
//! 60-card acceptance: a green-looking test asserting nothing.
