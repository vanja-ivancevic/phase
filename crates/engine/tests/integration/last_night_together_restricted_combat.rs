//! Last Night Together (cluster 61) — end-to-end runtime proof.
//!
//! Oracle:
//! > Choose two target creatures. Untap them. Put two +1/+1 counters on each of
//! > them. They gain vigilance, indestructible, and haste until end of turn.
//! > After this main phase, there is an additional combat phase. Only the chosen
//! > creatures can attack during that combat phase.
//!
//! Before the fix the sixth sentence parsed to `Effect::Unimplemented{name:"only"}`.
//! After the fix it folds onto the scheduled `Effect::AdditionalPhase` as an
//! `attacker_restriction`, the resolver snapshots the spell's chosen targets into
//! a fixed tracked set (CR 608.2h), and combat enforcement (CR 508.1c / CR 611.2c)
//! restricts the scheduled combat phase to those creatures.
//!
//! This test drives the real cast pipeline: cast LNT choosing two of three
//! controlled creatures, resolve, advance into the scheduled extra combat, and
//! assert that only the two chosen creatures may be declared as attackers — which
//! also proves parent→sub-ability target propagation reaches the AdditionalPhase
//! resolver. It then runs the combat out and asserts the restriction is cleared.
