//! BB-FU5 — a same-chain counter anaphor placed AFTER a token-creating clause
//! binds to the just-created token (`TargetFilter::LastCreated`), not the ability
//! source (`SelfRef`) or an unbound parent target (`ParentTarget`). Unifies two
//! parser call sites (`resolve_counter_placement_target`'s demonstrative arm and
//! `try_parse_for_each_effect`'s counter arm) on ONE helper,
//! `counter_anaphor_created_token_binding`.
//!
//! These drive the REAL parse/lower/resolve pipeline (`parse_effect_chain` plus
//! `resolve_ability_chain`) and assert RESOLVED counter placement, not AST bytes.
//! Each load-bearing FLIP names the assertion that reds when the fix is reverted
//! (measured by reverting the fix and re-running):
//!
//! `match_the_odds_for_each_it_binds_created_token` — reverting call site B to
//! `ParseContext::default()` re-binds "it" to `SelfRef`; token counters 3 -> 0.
//!
//! `grist_the_token_binds_created_token` — dropping "the token" from the helper
//! `alt` re-binds to unbound `ParentTarget`; token deathtouch counter 1 -> 0.
//!
//! `longstalk_brawl_the_creature_binds_chosen_target_not_token` — a no-regression
//! control proving "the creature" stays a chosen-target binding (resolves onto the
//! chosen creature, not a decoy token). The "the creature" EXCLUSION from the
//! `alt` is a forward-looking correctness measure: "the creature" is genuinely
//! ambiguous (Longstalk Brawl names a chosen target). Measured caveat: it is NOT
//! currently load-bearing — adding "the creature" to the `alt` flips ZERO corpus
//! cards, because Longstalk's `GiftDelivery` token is not seen by the
//! `token_created_in_chain` seeder (that flag is false here). The test reds only
//! if Longstalk's counter were ever (wrongly) parsed to `LastCreated` or if
//! `ParentTarget` resolution broke; it does not claim to discriminate the
//! exclusion itself.
