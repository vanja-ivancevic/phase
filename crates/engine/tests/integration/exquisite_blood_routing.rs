//! Regression: Exquisite Blood must route "you gain that much life" to the
//! ability's controller — not to the triggering opponent.
//!
//! Oracle text: "Whenever an opponent loses life, you gain that much life."
//!
//! Historical bug: a post-hoc `rewire_player_scoped_execute_to_triggering_player`
//! pass in `oracle_trigger.rs` re-bound the execute ability's `player_scope` to
//! `TriggeringPlayer` whenever the trigger's subject was opponent-scoped. That
//! ignored the *effect*-level subject ("you"), causing the opponent to gain
//! life instead of the controller. The fix deletes the rewire and relies on
//! the effect's own subject (`TargetFilter::Controller`) to route correctly.
//!
//! CR 119.3: If an effect causes a player to gain life, that player's life
//!           total is adjusted accordingly — the recipient is determined by
//!           the effect, not by the triggering event.
//! CR 603.7c: `EventContextAmount` resolves to the triggering event's amount.
//! CR 608.2k: Pronoun resolution — "you" in trigger effect text resolves to
//! the ability controller, regardless of the trigger's subject.
