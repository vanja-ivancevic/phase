//! Phase C1 follow-up (review finding): a mill batch must NOT strand cards when
//! a per-card `Moved` replacement surfaces a CR 616.1 ordering choice.
//!
//! With TWO simultaneously-applicable graveyard→exile redirects on the
//! battlefield (Rest in Peace + Leyline of the Void — a real, common
//! combination), the CR 616.1 materiality classifier
//! (`replacement.rs` — any destination-redirecting `Effect::ChangeZone` is
//! Unconditional-material) makes the engine prompt for ordering on EVERY milled
//! card, regardless of the identical outcome. The first milled card therefore
//! pauses the per-card delivery loop on `ZoneMoveResult::NeedsChoice`.
//!
//! Pre-fix, mill bailed with `return Ok(())` on that pause: cards 2..N were
//! silently stranded in the library with an orphaned pause. The fix parks the
//! undelivered tail in the active `BatchDelivery` frame and the
//! replacement-choice resume path (`handle_replacement_choice`) drains it after
//! each choice, re-parking when the next card surfaces its own prompt.
//!
//! This test mills 3 cards under both redirects, answers each CR 616.1 ordering
//! prompt, and asserts ALL milled cards left the library and ended in exile.
//! It FAILS (strands cards 2..3 in the library) on the pre-fix code.
