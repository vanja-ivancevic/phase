//! Memory Vessel (std S25) — runtime tests for the two engine building blocks
//! this card requires, driven through the real resolution / prune / apply
//! pipeline in a MULTIPLAYER (3-player) game.
//!
//! Card: "{T}, Exile this artifact: Each player exiles the top seven cards of
//! their library. Until your next turn, players may play cards they exiled this
//! way, and they can't play cards from their hand. Activate only as a sorcery."
//!
//! Two building blocks under test (both general, not Memory-Vessel-only):
//!   (a) `ProhibitedActivity::ProhibitPlayFromZone { zone }` — deny PLAY (cast
//!       OR land) from a zone. Enforced at the cast legal-actions surface, the
//!       actual cast gate, and the play-land gate.
//!   (b) The untap-step play-permission prune keys "until your next turn" on the
//!       granting effect's controller (`exiled_by_ability_controller`), so a
//!       per-owner grant (`PermissionGrantee::ObjectOwner`) expires at the
//!       ACTIVATOR's next turn, not each grantee's.
//!
//! The parser lowering of the compound sub-clause ("players may play cards they
//! exiled this way, and they can't play cards from their hand") is a separate,
//! currently-honest-red `Effect::unimplemented` item (stop-and-return); these
//! tests construct the effect chain the parser must eventually emit and prove
//! the engine primitives resolve it correctly.
