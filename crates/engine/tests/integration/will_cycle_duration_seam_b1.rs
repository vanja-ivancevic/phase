//! Phase B1 — the Will-cycle duration seam.
//!
//! Two independent parser units, both exercised through the crate's PUBLIC
//! surface:
//!
//! * **U1** (`parser/oracle_static/restriction.rs`) — a leading duration head
//!   on the graveyard cast/play permission. CR 611.2a: the head states the
//!   window; before U1 it blocked the entire permission body.
//! * **U2** (`parser/oracle_replacement.rs`) — an antecedent-INTERNAL window on
//!   the graveyard-exile replacement, captured as a typed `Duration` and
//!   stamped onto `ReplacementDefinition.expiry`. CR 514.2 + CR 611.2a: an
//!   unstamped window is not "missing", it is PERMANENT, because CR 611.2a
//!   makes an unstated duration last until the end of the game.
//!
//! **Where the stamped definition lives (issue #8781).** CR 604.2: a printed
//! static ability's replacement effect states no window, so a stated one proves
//! the definition was CREATED by a resolving spell or ability (CR 611.2a). U2
//! originally left such a definition hosted on the card, which this file's own
//! V5 comment already recorded as inert — `find_applicable_replacements` scans
//! the battlefield and command zone only. It now routes to
//! `Effect::AddTargetReplacement { target: None }` instead, which installs it
//! into the floating store at resolution under the resolving controller. Every
//! row below therefore reads `expiry` off [`windowed_installs`] rather than off
//! `parsed.replacements`; the invariant is unchanged and is still "nothing
//! permanent escapes".
//!
//! **Honesty statement.** B1 makes ZERO cards supported. Yawgmoth's Will,
//! Gaea's Will and Magus of the Will still parse to `Effect::Unimplemented`;
//! `v5_will_cycle_cards_remain_honestly_unsupported` pins that as a REGRESSION
//! GUARD, not as a discriminating test.
//!
//! **One precision on that statement.** "These cards parse to
//! `Effect::Unimplemented`" is only half true, and the nuance matters for
//! anyone who later closes this gap. The CAST half of "you may play lands and
//! cast spells from your graveyard" ALREADY lowers to `Effect::CastFromZone`,
//! in `sub_ability` — a position the instrument originally used to write this
//! file never read. Only the LAND half is refused, as the bare fragment
//! `"play lands"`, which `try_parse_cast_effect`'s guard declines because a
//! zone-less "play lands" genuinely is not a grant. So these cards are HALF
//! parsed, and `v5` below asserts only that a refusal is still present.
//!
//! **Parsing the land half is NOT sufficient to support these cards.**
//! MEASURED: `graveyard_lands_playable_by_permission` returns `[]` after
//! resolving the real Yawgmoth's Will even when both halves parse, because
//! `Effect::CastFromZone` is not a channel any land-permission consumer reads.
//! The consumers (`casting::graveyard_permission_sources`) read
//! `StaticMode::GraveyardCastPermission` instead. Closing this gap therefore
//! needs a DELIVERY seam, not another parser arm — see the U1 note below, which
//! is that seam's prerequisite.
//!
//! **Stack size.** `parse_oracle_text` overflows the default 8 MB test stack
//! and prints a convincing PARTIAL negative on the way down. Every body that
//! calls it therefore runs on a 256 MB thread via `on_big_stack`.
