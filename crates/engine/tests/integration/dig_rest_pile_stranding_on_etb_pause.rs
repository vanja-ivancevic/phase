//! Discriminating test for the rest-pile stranding bug in the dig
//! (`WaitingFor::DigChoice`) resolution path: when a kept card routed onto the
//! battlefield pauses on an as-enters aura-attachment choice (CR 303.4f — the
//! Aura has more than one legal host, so the controller must choose), the unkept
//! "rest pile" must still reach its destination once the choice resolves — it
//! must not be stranded in the library.
//!
//! Before the fix the handler bailed with an early `return` on the pause,
//! skipping `route_rest_partition`, so the unkept cards never left the library;
//! and the aura-attachment resume path (`WaitingFor::ReturnAsAuraTarget`) never
//! drained the parked batch tail. The fix defers the rest-pile move onto a
//! parked batch-completion continuation AND drains it on the aura resume path,
//! mirroring the surveil/manifest-dread rest-pile pattern.
