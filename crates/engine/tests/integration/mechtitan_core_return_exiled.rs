//! Regression for **Mechtitan Core** (no linked GitHub issue) —
//!
//! > {5}, Exile this Vehicle and four other artifact creatures and/or Vehicles
//! > you control: Create Mechtitan, a legendary 10/10 Construct artifact creature
//! > token … When that token leaves the battlefield, return all cards exiled with
//! > this Vehicle except this card to the battlefield tapped under their owners'
//! > control.
//!
//! At runtime the activated ability exiles the 4 others with `TrackedBySource`
//! links (`source_id = Mechtitan Core`) — the self-exiled Core is NOT self-linked,
//! so "except this card" falls out for free — and installs a delayed trigger
//! `WhenLeavesPlayFiltered{token} → ChangeZoneAll{ Exile→Battlefield,
//! ExiledBySource, enter_tapped: Tapped }` whose `source_id` is Core.
//!
//! THE BUG: Core self-exiles paying its own cost. Before the fix,
//! `apply_zone_exit_cleanup` pruned every `TrackedBySource` link keyed to Core the
//! instant Core left the battlefield, and the only fallback (`linked_exile_lki`)
//! is cleared on every phase/step transition. So when the token left many turns
//! later, `linked_exile_cards_for_source(Core)` returned `[]` and NOTHING came
//! back. This test reproduces that exact runtime shape (source self-exiles → a
//! phase passes → the token leaves) and asserts the pile returns TAPPED.
//!
//! THE FIX (`game/zones.rs`): preserve `TrackedBySource` links when a source
//! leaves the battlefield TO EXILE (CR 607.2a: the pile stays the linked-ability
//! referent while the source sits in exile with a stable ObjectId per CR 400.7),
//! and reset them only if that source RE-ENTERS the battlefield.
//!
//! DISCRIMINATOR: revert the exit-prune change → Core's self-exile drops the
//! links → the `== Battlefield` / `tapped` assertions flip to "still in Exile".
//!
//! CR references (verified against `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`):
//!   - CR 607.2a: an "exile …" ability and a "cards exiled with [this object]"
//!     ability are linked; the second refers to the exile-zone cards the first put
//!     there — the association does not depend on where the source now is.
//!   - CR 400.7: an object that changes zones becomes a new object; ObjectId is
//!     stable storage, so the self-exiled Core keeps its id in exile.
//!   - CR 614.12: an effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield
//!     (here, tapped) — the mass return honors `enter_tapped`.
