//! "If <C>, A. Otherwise, B." per-clause condition recognition — end-to-end.
//!
//! CR 608.2c + CR 603.4: a card that reads "If <condition>, <effect A>.
//! Otherwise, <effect B>." attaches B to A as A's `else_ability`. The "Otherwise"
//! plumbing keys off the FIRST preceding clause whose `condition.is_some()`. The
//! cards below previously dropped the "If <C>, A" clause's condition (it parsed
//! to `condition: null`), so the `else` branch found no anchor and the parser
//! emitted `Effect::Unimplemented { name: "otherwise" }` that ran B
//! unconditionally. The fix is purely per-clause condition recognition:
//!   - anaphoric/self permanent status ("if it's tapped" / "if it's suspected" /
//!     "if ~ is suspected") → Target/Source `MatchesFilter` (CR 611.2b, CR 701.60b);
//!   - negated saddled designation ("if ~ isn't saddled") → Not(SourceMatchesFilter)
//!     against `FilterProp::IsSaddled` (CR 702.171b);
//!   - "they lost life this turn" → `LifeLostThisTurn { Target }` (CR 119.3, CR 115.1);
//!   - "you don't control a Snail" → Not(IsPresent) (already supported).
//!
//! Each test drives BOTH branches through the real apply() pipeline so reverting
//! the condition recognition (which makes the `else` branch fire unconditionally)
//! fails the "if" branch's assertion.
