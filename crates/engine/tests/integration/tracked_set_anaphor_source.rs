//! CR 603.2c + CR 608.2c — WHICH set an anaphoric set-reference names.
//!
//! "their total power" / "the greatest power among them" / "… among those
//! creatures" are byte-identical phrases with two different referents, and they
//! resolve from two different pieces of state:
//!
//!   * the TRIGGERING BATCH — the objects of the current trigger event
//!     (`state.current_trigger_events`). Witch-king, Sky Scourge; Aloy, Savior
//!     of Meridian; Shriekwood Devourer; The Skullspore Nexus.
//!   * the CHAIN SET — the objects a PRECEDING clause of the same resolution
//!     published (`state.tracked_object_sets`). Kylox, Visionary Inventor, whose
//!     "their" is the creatures its own earlier clause just sacrificed.
//!
//! The leaf quantity combinator cannot tell them apart (the text is identical),
//! so it emits the batch reading and the clause layer re-anchors it to the chain
//! set when an EARLIER clause published one — `rebind_tracked_aggregate_to_chain_set`.
//!
//! The two readings are MUTUALLY DESTRUCTIVE, and this file pins that in both
//! directions: each card is asserted to produce the WRONG answer under the other
//! card's binding. A future change that collapses the two sources fails here.
//!
//! Oracle text is quoted from Scryfall, not from memory.
