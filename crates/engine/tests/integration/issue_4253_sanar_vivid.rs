//! Regression for GitHub issue #4253 — Sanar, Innovative First-Year's Vivid
//! ability revealed nonlands into hand before the per-color exile loop, so
//! `ForEachCategoryExile` saw an empty Library pool.
//!
//! CR 701.20b: revealed cards stay in the library until an effect moves them.
//! Sanar's "for each of those colors, you may exile a card of that color from
//! among the revealed cards" requires the reveal-until step to leave the pile
//! in the library.
//!
//! This file also owns the runtime coverage for the follow-on defect ("exiling
//! more than one card at a time isn't working"): Sanar's trailing "you may cast
//! the exiled cards this turn" exiled and granted a cast permission to EVERY
//! revealed card instead of only the per-color picks. Two seams were wrong:
//!
//! 1. the parser did not treat `ForEachCategory { action: ExileFromPool }` as a
//!    tracked-set publisher, so the cast anaphor stayed `ParentTarget`; and
//! 2. `cast_from_zone::resolve` read `ability.targets` unconditionally, so even
//!    a tracked-set-bound cast step saw whatever the chain seam had injected
//!    (for Sanar, the whole reveal window).
//!
//! Because seam 2 is shared by every `CastFromZone` with a tracked-set filter
//! (51 cards), the general building-block fixtures live here too rather than in
//! a new top-level test binary.
