//! Integration tests for The Ur-Dragon's Eminence ability — a card-class
//! regression for cost-reduction statics that function from the command zone.
//!
//! Oracle text (relevant fragment):
//!   Eminence — As long as The Ur-Dragon is in the command zone or on the
//!   battlefield, other Dragon spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.
//!
//! CR references:
//!   - CR 113.6b — an ability that "expressly mentions a zone its source
//!     object is in" functions in that zone. The Eminence static lists both
//!     Battlefield and Command via the typed disjunction in its `condition`,
//!     so `populate_active_zones_from_condition` seeds
//!     `active_zones = [Battlefield, Command]`.
//!   - CR 207.2c — "Eminence" is an ability word with no rules meaning; the
//!     condition clause is what makes the static function from the command
//!     zone (the ability-word strip leaves the static intact).
//!   - CR 408 — the command zone.
//!   - CR 601.2f — cost-reduction effects apply during cost-determination.
//!
//! What this exercises end-to-end:
//!   1. A Dragon-creature card in hand is cast while The Ur-Dragon is in the
//!      command zone (NOT on the battlefield). The {3} base cost is reduced
//!      to {2} so only 2 of 3 available lands are tapped.
//!   2. The same scenario with The Ur-Dragon on the battlefield — same
//!      reduction (Eminence functions from either listed zone).
//!   3. The same scenario with The Ur-Dragon in the graveyard — NO reduction
//!      (graveyard is not a listed zone; CR 113.6b denies function).
//!   4. Casting a Dragon equal to the Eminence source from the command zone —
//!      the `Another` filter prevents self-reduction.
