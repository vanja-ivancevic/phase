//! CR 303.4i: an Aura token whose host is undefined or illegal is NOT created (#7302).
//!
//! > If an effect attempts to put an Aura onto the battlefield attached to
//! > either an object or player it can't legally enchant or an object or player
//! > that is undefined, the Aura remains in its current zone. … If the Aura is a
//! > token, it isn't created.
//!
//! The engine used to create the token hostless and let the CR 704.5m
//! state-based action sweep it to a graveyard. That is observably different: the
//! token existed for a beat, fired enters-the-battlefield triggers, and left a
//! graveyard entry.
//!
//! Questing Cosplayer is the card that surfaced it, and it needed the parser
//! half too — "create a Questing Role token **and attach it to** target
//! creature" is the ACTION surface of the same CR 303.4 relation Oracle
//! otherwise prints as "…token **attached to** target creature", and only the
//! state surface was recognised, so the token was created with no host at all.
//!
//! ## What each row proves
//!
//! The production rows cast the card and let its enters trigger resolve, so the
//! parser binding, target selection and the token seam are proven together. The
//! rows marked as building blocks call `token::resolve` directly: they reach
//! shapes a card's own targeting layer would never hand the resolver (an
//! `attach_to` filter with NO bound target) or that the replacement pipeline
//! would have to be taught to produce (an entrant that stopped being an Aura).
//! They are evidence about the seam, not about a card.
//!
//! The third discriminator the rule needs — an UNBOUND host reached through the
//! production pipeline — lives in `self_attached_aura_token_host.rs`, whose
//! `RoleChain` rows activate a real ability whose host authority names nothing
//! (`CostPaidObject`, `SourceOrPaired`, an unbound chosen player) and assert the
//! same CR 303.4i outcome behind a reach guard. It is not repeated here.
//!
//! There is deliberately NO replay of the shipped Questing Cosplayer here. The
//! curated fixture stores the export's PRE-BAKED parse, which the card-data
//! pipeline regenerates — so a fixture replay would assert the old parse until
//! that pipeline runs, and would prove nothing about a parser change either way.
//! The rows below build the same printed sentence from Oracle text, which is
//! parsed by the parser under test at run time; for this PR that is the stronger
//! evidence, not the weaker one.
