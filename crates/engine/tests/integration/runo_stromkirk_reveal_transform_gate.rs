//! Issue #8586: Runo Stromkirk // Krothuss, Lord of the Deep — verbatim Oracle
//! front face:
//!   "Flying
//!    When Runo enters, put up to one target creature card from your graveyard
//!    on top of your library.
//!    At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top card of your library.
//!    You may reveal that card. If a creature card with mana value 6 or greater
//!    is revealed this way, transform Runo."
//!
//! THE DEFECT this file guards. `parse_if_revealed_card_type_conditional`
//! consumed `" card is revealed this way"` as a single `tag()`, leaving no slot
//! for the postnominal property. Runo's `"with mana value 6 or greater"` sits
//! exactly in that missing slot, so the head declined and the ENTIRE gate was
//! dropped (`condition: null` on the `Transform` node) — the upkeep trigger
//! turned Runo over regardless of what was on top of the library. CR 701.20a
//! (revealing) is the authorizing rule for the `"revealed this way"` anaphor;
//! CR 202.3 defines the mana value the gate bounds.
//!
//! MEASURED ROWS, at BASE (`3bc9531e7`) and after the parser fix:
//!
//! | row | shape | BASE | after the fix |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `runo_declining_a_reveal_below_the_mana_value_gate_does_not_transform` | MV2 creature on top, DECLINE | `true` (wrong) | **`false`** |
//! | `runo_declining_a_reveal_of_a_noncreature_does_not_transform` | MV6 instant on top, DECLINE | `true` (wrong) | **`false`** |
//! | `runo_declining_a_qualifying_reveal_still_transforms_residual_defect` | MV6 creature on top, DECLINE | `true` | `true` (unchanged) |
//! | `runo_fixture_parses_to_a_transform_gated_on_the_mana_value_floor` | parse-only | condition `None` | `Some(Cmc { GE, 6 })` |
//!
//! REVERTING the parser change flips rows 1, 2 and 4. Row 3 is a labelled
//! characterization row and a live positive control — see its own doc comment.
//!
//! WHEN DW#5 LANDS — DW#5 being the deferred fix for the residual defect row 3
//! records: a DECLINED optional reveal still writes the reveal ledger, so the
//! `"…is revealed this way"` gate is satisfied by a card no player was ever
//! shown (CR 701.20a + CR 608.2d) — flipping row 3's `true` to `false` is NOT
//! the only edit the file needs. Once a DECLINED reveal stops writing the
//! reveal ledger, reach guard 2 (`last_revealed_ids.len() == 1`) fails on ALL
//! THREE runtime rows and rows 1 and 2 stop discriminating. That is deliberate
//! — the file goes loudly red rather than silently vacuous — but the DW#5 fixer
//! must re-anchor that guard on a signal the declined path still produces (or
//! move these rows to the ACCEPT side), not just edit row 3.
//!
//! `DEFERRED(DW#5, Appendix A + PR body)` is scoped to the DECLINE rows only.
//! The Phase-2 ACCEPT rows below are unaffected by it: the reveal ledger is
//! written on the accept path either way, so their reach guard 2 keeps holding.
//! After Phase 2 this file's Phase-1 discrimination is therefore carried by the
//! two ACCEPT negatives (MV2 creature, MV6 instant) as well as by the decline
//! rows — measured `TRUE` (wrong) with Phase 2 alone, `false` in the chartered
//! order.
//!
//! TWO MEASURED FOOT-GUNS, both closed here on purpose:
//!   1. The fixture's card NAME must be exactly `"Runo Stromkirk"` — see the
//!      warning on `RUNO_ORACLE`. A misnamed fixture reports
//!      `transformed=false, answered=true, last_revealed=1` on BOTH sides: it
//!      looks like a healthy negative and measures nothing.
//!   2. The harness shape must start at `Phase::PreCombatMain` with Runo under
//!      **P1** and then `advance_to_phase(Phase::Upkeep)`. The phase TRANSITION
//!      is what fires the trigger, and the trigger carries `OnlyDuringYourTurn`,
//!      so a Runo under P0 in this shape is never offered the reveal at all.
//!   3. The drive must STOP when the upkeep trigger's resolution is complete.
//!      `drive_upkeep` runs only while the trigger is on the stack (or the
//!      machine is parked in `OptionalEffectChoice`). The next priority pass
//!      after that ends the upkeep step and runs the draw (CR 503.1 ->
//!      CR 504.1), and a fixture whose accept branch just moved its only library
//!      card to hand then draws from an empty library and **loses the game**
//!      (CR 704.5b). MEASURED: with an unbounded drive the Sidequest ACCEPT row
//!      reads `transformed=false, answered=true, last_revealed=1` with
//!      `waiting_for = GameOver` — and ALL FOUR of the original reach guards
//!      still pass, so it looks exactly like a healthy negative while measuring
//!      nothing. Reach guard 5 (`phase == Phase::Upkeep`, game not over) exists
//!      to make that visible. Do not "simplify" `drive_upkeep` back to a bare
//!      loop budget, and do not paper over it by padding the library: padding
//!      leaves the drive running past the measurement and was measured still
//!      ending the game.
//!
//! Every runtime row asserts four reach guards in the same test (the optional
//! was genuinely offered and answered, exactly one card was looked at, a
//! `back_face` is installed, and the object's name), so no negative can pass
//! vacuously.
//!
//! PHASE 2 HAS LANDED, and the ACCEPT side is covered here now. `Effect::Transform`
//! resolved its `Single`-scope subject POSITIONALLY out of `ability.targets`, so
//! the object an earlier chain instruction bound displaced the printed
//! self-reference and the engine made an OFF-BATTLEFIELD card the subject — the
//! looked-at library card for Runo and Delver, and for Sidequest the card its
//! own `ChangeZone` parent had already moved to hand. `transform_permanent`
//! rejects an object that is not on the battlefield, so the printed transform
//! never happened. `crates/engine/src/game/effects/transform_effect.rs` now
//! resolves the subject through `targeting::resolved_targets` (CR 201.5).
//!
//! MEASURED ACCEPT-SIDE ROWS, taken BEFORE this PR's engine commit and after
//! it. "Before" means the state this PR's Phase 1 leaves behind, and is how the
//! discrimination is reproduced: revert
//! `crates/engine/src/game/effects/transform_effect.rs` alone to its pre-PR
//! state, keeping Phase 1's parser fix in the tree.
//!
//! | row | shape | before Phase 2 | after Phase 2 |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `runo_transforms_when_top_card_is_a_creature_with_mana_value_six` | MV6 creature, ACCEPT | `false` | **`true`** |
//! | `runo_accepting_a_reveal_below_the_mana_value_gate_does_not_transform` | MV2 creature, ACCEPT | `false` | `false` |
//! | `runo_accepting_a_reveal_of_a_noncreature_does_not_transform` | MV6 instant, ACCEPT | `false` | `false` |
//! | `delver_of_secrets_transforms_when_top_card_is_an_instant` | Delver, instant, ACCEPT | `false` | **`true`** |
//! | `delver_of_secrets_does_not_transform_when_top_card_is_a_creature` | Delver, creature, ACCEPT | `false` | `false` |
//! | `sidequest_catch_a_fish_transforms_when_the_reveal_is_accepted` | Sidequest, creature, ACCEPT | `false` | **`true`** |
//! | `sidequest_catch_a_fish_does_not_transform_when_the_reveal_is_declined` | Sidequest, DECLINE | `false` | `false` |
//! | `a_bare_look_then_transform_chain_transforms_the_source` | synthetic bare `Dig -> Transform` | `false` | **`true`** |
//! | `a_transform_after_a_non_revealing_instruction_is_unaffected` | synthetic `PutCounter -> Transform` | `true` | `true` |
//!
//! REVERTING `crates/engine/src/game/effects/transform_effect.rs` ALONE flips
//! the four bolded rows red. The five unbolded rows pass on both sides and are
//! labelled in their own doc comments as negatives or controls, not as
//! discriminators.
//!
//! `setup`, `seed_library_top`, `drive_upkeep` and `assert_reach_guards` are
//! parameterized — on the printed permanent kind (`FixturePermanent`), the drive
//! shape (`UpkeepDrive`), the top card's core type and mana value, the expected
//! reveal-ledger size and the back face — so all three cards and both synthetics
//! share one harness rather than a cluster of near-duplicate helpers.
