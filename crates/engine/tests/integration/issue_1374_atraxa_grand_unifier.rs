//! Regression: GitHub issue #1374 — Atraxa, Grand Unifier ETB must let the
//! controller choose from among the revealed library cards, not from the
//! graveyard (or any other stale tracked set).
//!
//! Oracle (ETB half):
//!   "When Atraxa enters, reveal the top ten cards of your library. For each
//!    card type, you may put a card of that type from among the revealed cards
//!    into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random
//!    order."
//!
//! Bug: `RevealTop` emits `CardsRevealed`, not `ZoneChanged`, so
//! `affected_objects_from_events` published an empty tracked set. `ChooseFromZone`
//! then fell back to `latest_tracked_set_id`, which could return a stale
//! graveyard/mill set from an earlier resolution — offering only graveyard cards.
//!
//! CR 701.20b: Revealing does not move cards; the choice pool is the revealed set.
//! CR 608.2d: "From among" restricts the resolution-time choice to that set.
