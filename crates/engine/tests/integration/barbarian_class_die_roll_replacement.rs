//! CR 706.6 + CR 614.1a — die-roll replacement effects that modify how many dice
//! are rolled and discard rolls.
//!
//! Barbarian Class (level 1), verified verbatim against Scryfall:
//! > If you would roll one or more dice, instead roll that many dice plus one
//! > and ignore the lowest roll.
//!
//! CR 706.1 scopes a die-roll event to the whole INSTRUCTION ("how many of those
//! dice to roll"), so a "roll a d20" instruction proposes one
//! `ProposedEvent::RollDice { count: 1 }`; the replacement raises it to 2 and
//! attaches `DieRollIgnoreRule::Lowest`. CR 706.6 then makes the ignored roll
//! "considered to have never happened", so it emits no `GameEvent::DieRolled`,
//! receives no modifier, runs no results branch, and contributes nothing to the
//! aggregate "equal to the result(s)" value.
//!
//! Every assertion here is ordered reach-guard FIRST: the failure value on this
//! path is 0 (no rolls found / a wiped die result), so an assertion of the form
//! "the value is not the ignored die's" would pass VACUOUSLY against 0. Each
//! test therefore asserts the effect happened AT ALL before asserting which
//! value it saw.
