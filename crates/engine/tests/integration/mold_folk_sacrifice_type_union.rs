//! Mold Folk — "Mold Harvest — {1}, Sacrifice another creature or an artifact:
//! Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature."
//!
//! CR 205.2a (a cost filter may be a two-leg card-TYPE union) + CR 601.2h (the
//! activation cost is paid with permanents matching that filter) + CR 701.21a
//! (sacrifice).
//!
//! The right conjunct of the union leads with an indefinite article, and the
//! shared type-phrase grammar deliberately leaves that tail as remainder — the
//! same surface is an elided-verb clause elsewhere ("you control a land creature
//! or a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn", Earth Rumble Wrestlers). The
//! sacrifice-cost parser now opts into the union reading via
//! `fold_article_led_type_union`, so the cost's filter is
//! `Or[Creature+Another, Artifact]` rather than `Creature+Another` alone.
//!
//! Note the ASYMMETRY, which is the rules-load-bearing part: "another" scopes only
//! the LEFT conjunct. The right one carries its own determiner ("an artifact"), so
//! it is not "another artifact" and the source may pay with ITSELF once it is an
//! artifact. Official rulings — Elite Headhunter (2019-10-04): "If Elite Headhunter
//! somehow becomes an artifact, you can sacrifice it to pay the cost of its
//! activated ability"; Gut, True Soul Zealot (2022-06-10): "If Gut somehow becomes
//! an artifact, you may sacrifice it to its own ability." The third test below
//! drives exactly that.
//!
//! Before the fix the artifact leg was dropped, so a controller holding only an
//! artifact could not pay a cost the card plainly allows. This drives the real
//! activation pipeline (`GameAction::ActivateAbility` → cost payment → stack →
//! resolution) rather than asserting a parsed filter shape.
