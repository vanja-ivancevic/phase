//! 5d U5 — the Fantastic Four bounded-loop acceptance rows, driven from the REAL 4-player
//! playtest dump through the production `apply()` boundary.
//!
//! This module is the first commit that TRACKS
//! `crates/engine/tests/fixtures/fantastic_four_bounded_loop_4p.json.gz`; it ships with its
//! loader in the same change (a tracked fixture with no tracked loader is residue).
//!
//! # The board (CR 732.2a)
//!
//! Four Fantastic Four permanents, all P0-controlled, chained into one self-sustaining cycle:
//!
//! * **Human Torch, Johnny Storm** (`403`) — *"Whenever you draw a card, if you control another
//!   Hero, ~ deals 1 damage to target opponent."* — a CR 608.2b TARGET choice, three legal
//!   opponents.
//! * **The Thing, Ben Grimm** (`404`) — mandatory `PutCounter`, no choice.
//! * **Invisible Woman, Sue Storm** (`402`) — an `optional` (CR 603.5 "may") token creation.
//! * **Mister Fantastic, Reed Richards** (`401`) — *"Whenever one or more tokens you control
//!   enter, you may draw a card."* — a second CR 603.5 "may", whose draw re-triggers Torch.
//!
//! Per cycle: P1 loses 1 life, P0's library loses 1 card, two `+1/+1` counters are added.
//!
//! # MEASURED SCOPE OF THIS MODULE — read this before adding a row
//!
//! The bounded offer FIRES on this dump (that is 5d's headline and [`r1_the_bounded_offer_fires_
//! on_the_real_f4_dump`] is the row). It publishes **all three** per-iteration choices this
//! cycle opens — Sue's `MayChoice`, Reed's `MayChoice` and Torch's `Targets` slot — and the
//! mechanism is measured and pinned by
//! [`r1b_the_published_point_set_is_exactly_what_the_retained_window_announces`].
//!
//! ⚠ **THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH SAID THE OPPOSITE, AND IT WAS A MEASUREMENT OF A BLIND SPOT, NOT
//! OF THE BOARD.** The CR 732.2a ring sampler used to fire only at `Priority { player ==
//! active_player }` after a non-shrinking resolution, so on this board the retained frames
//! alternated strictly between the `404` and `402` stack entries; `certified_period_touch`'s
//! `announced` set is "entries in a frame's stack that were absent from the previous frame's",
//! which made the `403` and `401` entries structurally invisible to conjunct (6) and to
//! `bounded_cycle_pin_slots_for_window`. Torch and Reed resolve ACROSS a forced pre-priority
//! window, and that window is exactly what the old site could not see. The second sampling site
//! records a frame at the beat such a window is **ANSWERED**, so those two entries are now
//! announced like the other two — a widening of what the offer can publish, not a change to
//! what the board does.
//!
//! CONSEQUENCE, also measured and pinned
//! ([`r2a_an_accepted_declaration_commits_exactly_n_cycles_because_reeds_may_is_announced`]): an
//! accepted `Fixed(n)` declaration carrying the full published pin set now **commits exactly
//! `n` repetitions** — P1 loses `n` life, P0's library loses `n` cards — and `n = 1` and `n = 3`
//! are DISTINGUISHABLE. The former zero-commit was the fail-closed abort on Reed's unpinned
//! "may"; with Reed published there is nothing left to abort on.

/// "can't include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event determines the next

///
/// On the offer-beat board, ONE CR 614.1 replacement definition that the resolver's OWN

/// `find_applicable_replacements`, and is NOT a scan over `def.event` NAMES. A name scan
/// cannot distinguish the seven definitions below — they differ only in their `event` name.
///
/// # MEASURED PLAN CORRECTION — the plan's ChangeZone/token keying does not fire
///
/// §6 R9 keys this row on *"a def carrying `event: ReplacementEvent::ChangeZone` … because
/// Sue's `ProposedEvent::CreateToken` draws it via the `ChangeZone` registry key"*. Measured on
/// this board, that def leaves the offer standing — and the reason is already on record in this
/// lane: U1-fin measured that `Effect::Token` never sets `CreateToken.copy`, and
/// `apply_create_token_after_replacement_with_created_ids` gates the whole `TokenEntry` route
/// on `if let Some(copy) = copy`, so **an `Effect::Token` resolution derives no token-entry
/// event at all** (the same fact that re-keyed R19a). Sue's trigger IS an `Effect::Token`
/// (`Wall` 0/4), so the plan's board cannot reach its own stated mechanism.
///
/// The row is therefore re-keyed onto the announced entry whose derivation the resolver DOES
/// produce: **The Thing's mandatory `PutCounter P1P1 ×2`, deriving `ProposedEvent::AddCounter`**
/// — same class, same seam, same conjunct, on the same real board. The falsified keys are not
/// dropped: they ship as arm (b), where their NON-firing is the discriminator.
///
/// # Arms

/// * **(pos)** the UNMODIFIED offer-beat board OFFERS through the metered seam — asserted

/// * **(a′)** the SAME definition, MANDATORY ⇒ still OFFERS. CR 616.1: a lone quantity
///   modification commutes with nothing, so there is no ordering choice to make. This is what

/// could belong to some other conjunct.
///
/// # REVERT-PROBES — RUN, and the FIRST FOUR MEASURED **NOT** TO FLIP, which is the finding

/// | **all three prompt arms AND the discharge conjunct** | **OFFERS ⇒ (a) FAILS** |
///
/// Measured at the seam with a throwaway instrument (run, read, deleted): on the unprobed tree
/// The Thing's entry classifies `MayPrompt` — the resolver's OWN probe detects the pending

// U6 — the AI's candidate set at the real F4 offer, and what the engine does with it
//
// Reachability of the seam under test: `phase_ai::search::choose_action` dispatches
// `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut { .. } => engine::ai_support::legal_actions(state)`
// (`crates/phase-ai/src/search.rs`), and `legal_actions` funnels into the
// `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` arm of `engine::ai_support::candidates`. These rows drive the
// REAL dump to the REAL offer and measure that arm's output there, plus what
// `handle_declare_shortcut` does with each member of it.
//
// ⚠ MEASURED SCOPE. §5 U6 as planned expects a declare candidate "whose template pins all
// three F4 slots (or declines)". F4 does publish all THREE slots — `r1b` pins
// `[Sue MayChoice, Reed MayChoice, Torch Targets]` — and the measured answer is still the
// SECOND branch: the AI DECLINES, because the only declaration it can emit is one the engine
// refuses outright. The generator builds no pinning template at ALL (its only `Fixed` candidate
// carries `template: None`), so a published set of three is exactly as unreachable for it as a
// set of one would have been — the count is not what excludes it, its emptiness gate is. These
// rows pin that, name the two independent reasons, and pin the accepted shape the generator
// never emits — they do not assert the planned prediction.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// **Row D6 — WIRE / POSITIVE.** At the real F4 bounded offer the AI candidate generator now
/// emits `DeclareShortcut { Fixed(max_iterations), Some(declaration) }` beside the decline, and
/// the `template` it carries IS THE OFFER'S OWN published declaration — not one the AI built.
///
/// ⚠ **THIS ROW'S PREVIOUS CLAIM WAS THE OPPOSITE, AND IT IS SUPERSEDED, NOT BROKEN.** As
/// `u6_the_ai_candidate_set_at_the_f4_offer_is_decline_only` it asserted
/// `assert_eq!(actions, vec![GameAction::DeclineShortcut])` — that the generator could offer no
/// declaration at all, because its only `Fixed` candidate carried `template: None` and a
/// published pin set fail-closes on that. Publishing the offer's own declaration is exactly the
/// capability item-4 C2b adds, so the old assertion asserted the ABSENCE of this commit's
/// subject. The name had to change with it: "decline only" is now false on this board.
///
/// # What is kept, and why
///
/// Both reach-guards survive verbatim and have flipped from exclusion conjuncts to POSITIVE
/// ones: `is_bounded()` is the count gate, and a NON-empty `points` set is what makes the
/// declaration (rather than the empty-schema `None`) the reason the candidate appears. The
/// `predicted_winner == None` guard stays as a measured property of this board.
///
/// # Non-vacuity
///
/// The template is asserted EQUAL to `offer_declaration(&state)`, never merely `Some(_)`: a
/// generator that fabricated its own conformant-looking template would satisfy `is_some()` and
/// fail this. `d6n_a_points_carrying_offer_without_a_declaration_enumerates_only_decline`
/// (in-crate, `ai_support/candidates.rs`) is the paired negative — with `declaration: None` the
/// candidate must NOT appear.
///
/// REVERT-PROBE: drop the `|| declaration.is_some()` disjunct from the generator's gate ⇒ the
/// candidate disappears against this points-carrying offer ⇒ the equality flips.

/// ITEM 2 (CR 732.2a) — the DECLARE seam: **on an offer that published no declaration of its

/// table below.
///
/// **WHY THIS FIXTURE AND NOT `loop_shortcut.rs`.** Site F sits under
/// `if !offer.schema.points.is_empty()`. The dina bounded offer publishes an EMPTY point set
/// (asserted green by that module's acceptance row), so this row would be structurally VACUOUS
/// there. The F4 offer publishes all three of this cycle's per-iteration choices, so the arm is
/// live here and only here. That fixture choice is load-bearing, not incidental.
///
/// **WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT ROW FROM THE MINT ARMS.** The mint-seam instrument
/// (`try_offer_bounded_cycle_shortcut`) cannot observe `handle_declare_shortcut` at all —
/// different seam, different instrument. Any future change to this routing discriminant needs
/// BOTH a mint-seam row and a declare-seam row; neither covers the other.
///
/// **THE HAZARD, and it is the one direction in which relaxing step (1b) makes the engine LESS
/// safe than before.** A `template: None` declaration against a non-empty schema skips pin
/// validation entirely — legitimate for exactly one drive shape, the object-growth route, which
/// re-derives its template from `last_loop_action_sequence`. Once (1b) went seat-relative, a
/// bounded offer can be minted with a FOREIGN period in state; under a merely-non-empty test that
/// foreign period would take the unvalidated sibling arm and open the CR 732.2b APNAP window on a
/// client-supplied declaration. The arm therefore asks whose period it is.
///
/// **ALL THREE ARMS RUN ON AN OFFER WHOSE OWN `declaration` IS CLEARED (item-4 C2).** That is
/// the offer shape site F still decides — `handle_declare_shortcut` resolves a `template: None`
/// declaration against `offer.declaration` above the pin block, so an offer that published one
/// bypasses site F entirely. The clearing keeps this row on its own subject instead of silently
/// converting it into a `declaration_conforms` row; the fourth arm below is the paired positive
/// that proves the clearing is the operative axis. See the closure's own comment for why a
/// declaration-free offer is a reachable production shape rather than a contrivance.
///
/// | arm | offer `declaration` | sequence | expected `waiting_for` |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | EMPTY-seq | cleared | empty | `Priority` (fail-closed) — must-not-flip |
/// | OWN-seq | cleared | proposer's | `RespondToShortcut` (the legitimate object-growth route) — must-not-flip |
/// | FOREIGN-seq | cleared | an opponent's | `Priority` — **the remedy** |
/// | RETAINED | **retained** | empty | `RespondToShortcut` — **the C2 paired positive**: one field apart from EMPTY-seq, and it flips |
///
/// **TWO-SIDED CONTROL, PER ASSERTION** — no constant implementation passes:
/// * **DROP** the proposer test (restore `state.last_loop_action_sequence.is_empty()`) ⇒
///   FOREIGN-seq returns `RespondToShortcut` ⇒ THAT assertion fails, while EMPTY/OWN still pass.
/// * **TRIVIALIZE** to always-reject ⇒ OWN-seq returns `Priority` ⇒ **that** assertion fails
///   instead (the shipped object-growth declarations break — the tree's own doc above this arm
///   says keying on `template.is_none()` alone does exactly this). TRIVIALIZE to never-reject ⇒
///   EMPTY-seq returns `RespondToShortcut` ⇒ that assertion fails.
/// * **REVERT item-4 C2** (drop `let template = template.or_else(|| offer.declaration.cloned())`
///   from `handle_declare_shortcut`) ⇒ the RETAINED arm returns `Priority` ⇒ **that** assertion
///   fails, while the three cleared-offer arms are untouched (they have no declaration to
///   resolve against, so the `or_else` was already a no-op for them).
///
/// ⚠ **WHAT THIS ROW DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT — a realized negative, recorded rather than
/// re-keyed.** Continuing each ACCEPTED arm through `accept_all_opponents` was measured, and both
