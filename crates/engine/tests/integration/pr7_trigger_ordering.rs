//! PR-7 Part B2 — production-path (headline) test for the CR 603.3b trigger-ordering
//! fix: a simultaneous, order-dependent, TARGETED batch is ordered exactly ONCE, not
//! re-prompted after every target selection.
//!
//! Root cause (pre-fix): `dispatch_collected_triggers` parks the already-ordered tail
//! into the flat `deferred_triggers` vec on a target pause; the re-drain
//! (`drain_deferred_trigger_queue_unchecked`) re-runs `begin_trigger_ordering` on the
//! still-order-dependent tail and RE-PROMPTS — a second `OrderTriggers` popup on a batch
//! the player already ordered. CR 603.3b: a simultaneous batch is ordered once in the
//! two-part APNAP process, never re-ordered per target.
//!
//! Fix: an ephemeral `DecisionTemplate` coverage marker registered when the group is
//! ordered lets the gate's 3rd arm auto-apply the chosen order (coverage-only) to every
//! shrinking parked-tail suffix instead of re-prompting.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 603.3b: simultaneous triggers are ordered once, in APNAP order.
//!   - CR 608.2b: a triggered ability's targets are chosen as it goes on
//!     the stack.
//!   - CR 704.5g: a creature with lethal marked damage is destroyed by SBA. CR 704.3:
//!     all applicable state-based actions are performed simultaneously as a single
//!     event — the three deaths are one ordering batch.
