//! Telling Time-class remainder split: "look at the top N, put some into your
//! hand, and split what's left between the TOP and the BOTTOM of your library."
//!
//! CARD TEXT (Telling Time, {1}{U} instant, Scryfall-verified):
//! "Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of those cards into
//! your hand, one on top of your library, and one on the bottom of your
//! library."
//!
//! Before this change the trailing "one on top ... and one on the bottom"
//! clause was SILENTLY SWALLOWED — the card parsed to
//! `Dig { destination: Hand, keep_count: 1, rest_destination: None }`, and a
//! `rest_destination` of `None` defaults to the GRAVEYARD. Telling Time milled
//! two cards instead of returning them to the library, with no
//! `Effect::Unimplemented` and no red coverage to show for it.
//!
//! The capability is composed of shipped building blocks:
//!   * `Effect::Dig.rest_split_top_count` (CR 401.2 — a library is one
//!     face-down pile, so top and bottom are the only two positions an
//!     instruction can name) carries how many of the remainder go on top.
//!   * `WaitingFor::DigRestSplitChoice` (CR 701.20e — the remainder was shown
//!     only to the looking player) is the follow-up prompt.
//!   * `route_rest_split_then` reuses the same per-card
//!     `ZoneMoveRequest::effect(..).at_library_position(..)` primitive as the
//!     uniform `route_rest_partition_then`; only the position varies.
