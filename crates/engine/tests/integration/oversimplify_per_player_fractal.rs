//! Oversimplify (SOC/C21/DSC/PRM) — per-player Fractal token counter count.
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   "Exile all creatures. Each player creates a 0/0 green and blue Fractal
//!    creature token and puts a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the
//!    total power of creatures they controlled that were exiled this way."
//!
//! Pre-fix bug: the dynamic-quantity clause was silently swallowed at parse
//! time (`SwallowedClause` / `DynamicQty`), so the Fractal token entered with
//! `enter_with_counters: []` and was a 0/0 — instantly dead to SBAs. Four
//! repairs land the card end-to-end:
//!
//!   1. Parser — `try_parse_put_counters_on_token_followup` now accepts the
//!      third-person `puts ` verb AND the `"a number of <type> counters on it
//!      equal to <quantity>"` body (delegating to the shared
//!      `parse_dynamic_counter_suffix_body`).
//!   2. Parser — `parse_type_phrase_folding_with_ctx` lowers
//!      `"creatures they controlled that were exiled this way"` into a
//!      composite `And{Typed{Creature,ScopedPlayer}, ExiledBySource}` filter.
//!   3. Engine — `QuantityRef::Aggregate{Power|Toughness}` falls back to the
//!      LKI snapshot when the matched object is off battlefield, per CR 608.2h
//!      + CR 400.7. Without this, the aggregate returned 0 because
//!        `obj.power` is `None` for non-battlefield objects.
//!   4. Engine — `Typed{controller: ...}` filter evaluation falls back to the
//!      LKI controller for non-battlefield objects, so "they controlled"
//!      semantics work even for stolen creatures (whose post-exile controller
//!      resets to owner).
//!
//! This test drives the real resolver (`resolve_ability_chain`) end-to-end:
//! exile all creatures, then verify each player's Fractal token enters with
//! the correct counter count equal to that player's total exiled power.
