//! CR 702.78 — Conspire granted by a static ability (Wort, the Raidmother /
//! Rassilon, the War President) must offer its optional additional cost and copy
//! the spell when that cost is paid, exactly like printed Conspire.
//!
//! Conspire was previously synthesized only from a card's *printed* Conspire
//! keyword (`synthesize_conspire`). A spell that gains Conspire from a
//! `StaticMode::CastWithKeyword` static never had the cost offered or the copy
//! produced, because the synthesis path keys off printed keywords and the
//! casting ladder / `process_triggers` had no granted-Conspire seam. This
//! mirrors the working granted-Casualty path (CR 702.153).
//!
//! CR 702.78a: "Conspire" = an additional cost ("tap two untapped creatures
//! you control that each share a color with it") plus a reflexive "when you
//! cast this spell, if its conspire cost was paid, copy it" trigger.
//!
//! CARD TEXT: Wort's oracle text below is this engine's authoritative card data
//! (`client/public/card-data.json`): "Each red or green instant or sorcery spell
//! you cast has conspire." The spell under test is a *red* instant, so Wort's
//! static grants it Conspire regardless of the pre-existing parser quirk in the
//! red Or-branch (which drops the instant/sorcery type constraint — out of
//! scope; a red instant matches either way).
