//! CR 108.4 + CR 108.4a (issue #8506): the hand and graveyard activation scans
//! in `ai_support` scope by the card's OWNER, and both halves of the surface —
//! the offered action set (`candidates.rs`) and the blocked-ability read-out
//! (`activation_block_reasons`, added in #8504) — must agree on that scope.
//!
//! **The rule.** CR 108.4: "A card doesn't have a controller unless that card
//! represents a permanent or spell." CR 108.4a: "If anything asks for the
//! controller of a card that doesn't have one (because it's not a permanent or
//! spell), use its owner instead." CR 404.1 puts a card into its OWNER's
//! graveyard. CR 602.2 carries the restriction that consumes all of this:
//! "Only an object's controller (or its owner, if it doesn't have a controller)
//! can activate its activated ability."
//!
//! **On the issue's premise.** #8506 predicted a live bug: a creature an
//! opponent had gained control of dies into its owner's graveyard still carrying
//! `obj.controller = opponent`, so the owner's flashback / unearth / escape
//! activation is dropped. Two comments in the tree assert the same thing
//! (`effects/change_zone.rs`'s player-scoped mass-move comment, and
//! `database/synthesis.rs`'s persist-test rationale). Both are STALE, and
//! `controller_defaults_to_owner_after_*` below is the measurement that says so:
//!
//! * `zones::apply_zone_exit_cleanup` reverts `controller` on a battlefield
//!   exit after all — `reset_for_battlefield_exit` rewrites `base_controller` to
//!   the owner (zones.rs:429), and `revert_layered_characteristics_to_base`
//!   reads it back into `controller` (zones.rs:573). The two sit in DIFFERENT
//!   `from == Zone::Battlefield` blocks — the ones opening at zones.rs:428 and
//!   zones.rs:538 — so a reader who checks only the first call sees the reset
//!   and misses the read-back. That is exactly how the two stale comments below
//!   went wrong.
//! * A foreign cast does not diverge either — but the REASON is version-scoped,
//!   so read the measurement rather than a mechanism. Measured on 4bfe5d886e
//!   (pre-#8332): `controller_defaults_to_owner_after_a_foreign_cast_resolves`
//!   green. Re-measured on the merge of #8332 into this branch: still green.
//!   The two runs are green for DIFFERENT reasons, which is why the mechanism
//!   must not be stated flatly here:
//!     - before #8332 a stack object's `controller` was never seeded from its
//!       `StackEntry`, so there was no divergence to carry off the stack. That
//!       is the defect #8332's own message describes ("a spell cast from a zone
//!       its caster does not own kept the OWNER as its controller");
//!     - after #8332 a stack object DOES carry the live controller, and
//!       `zones::apply_zone_exit_cleanup` restores the owner on the way out via
//!       a DESTINATION-keyed reset (`if !matches!(to, Zone::Battlefield |
//!       Zone::Stack) { controller = base_controller.unwrap_or(owner) }`, cited
//!       there to CR 109.4 + CR 108.4a).
//!
//! An earlier revision of this file said "a spell's caster lives on its
//! `StackEntry`, not on the `GameObject`". Post-#8332 that sentence is false
//! while the assertion it justified still passes — the exact shape that survives
//! a merge unnoticed and gets quoted forward.
//!
//! So the owner scope is not repairing an observable drop today; it states the
//! rule the owner-keyed zone lists already encode. Two mutations establish that,
//! and NEITHER turns this file red. Both were re-run after the #8332 merge rather
//! than inherited, because a mutation verdict is only valid for the tree it was
//! measured in:
//!
//! * reverting all six scans to `obj.controller == player` — measured green on
//!   4bfe5d886e, and re-measured green in the merged tree (4 passed, 0 failed);
//! * deleting the six guards outright (`if true`) — measured green on
//!   4bfe5d886e, and re-measured green in the merged tree (4 passed, 0 failed).
//!
//! Mutation B is green because each loop already iterates
//! `state.players[player].{hand,graveyard}`, which is keyed by owner, so no other
//! player's card reaches the guard at all. Mutation A is green because nothing
//! reachable puts a card in a hand or graveyard with `controller != owner`.
//!
//! The guard is therefore a statement of scope rather than a live filter, and no
//! test in this repository can discriminate on its predicate. What the file DOES
//! pin is the two things a future change could break silently: the zone-exit
//! invariant the scope relies on, and the read-out/offer partition from #8504.
//!
//! One production path DOES produce `controller != owner` off the battlefield and
//! is deliberately not covered here: `effects/copy_spell.rs` clones the copied
//! spell's object and overwrites only `controller`, never `owner`, so a Twincast
//! on an opponent's spell yields a stack object owned by them and controlled by
//! you (CR 707.10 says the copy is owned by its controller). Filed as its own
//! issue. It cannot reach these scans — the copy is a token that CR 707.10a
//! ceases on leaving the stack, and nothing has a stack-zoned activation.
