//! Runtime regression for Another Round — "Exile any number of creatures you
//! control, then return them to the battlefield under their owner's control.
//! Then repeat this process X more times." (CR 608.2c).
//!
//! Another Round is `{X}{X}{W}`, so "X more times" is the mana-{X}. The parser
//! stamps the ROOT ability with `repeat_for = Offset { Ref(Variable X), +1 }` —
//! the TOTAL run count ("once + X more"). The ungated whole-chain driver
//! (`repeated_full_chain`, effects/mod.rs) then loops the full exile→return
//! process X+1 times.
//!
//! The exile "any number of creatures you control" parses to a variable-count
//! `multi_target` (min 0 / max unbounded), so the chosen creatures are the
//! ability's targets (as they would be after the cast-time
//! `MultiTargetSelection`). Each loop iteration re-runs the whole chain against
//! those targets: exile them, then return them (CR 400.7 — each returns as a new
//! object, so they are summoning-sick afterward).
//!
//! Discriminating assertions:
//! - With M creatures and chosen X = N, the exile→return process runs exactly
//!   N+1 times → exactly `M * (N+1)` battlefield→exile transitions. Reverting the
//!   recognizer's `Offset(+1)` → `Offset(+0)` drops it to `M * N`; removing the
//!   "<q> more times" arm drops `repeat_for` to `None` and the chain runs once
//!   (`M` transitions).
//! - With chosen X = 0, the process runs exactly once (`M` transitions).
//!   Reverting to `Offset(+0)` makes X=0 resolve to 0 iterations — the process
//!   never runs (0 transitions).
//! - CR 400.7: the returned creatures are new objects, hence summoning-sick.
