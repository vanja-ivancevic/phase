//! Stack-budget regression for `GameState`'s inline size.
//!
//! `phase-server` moves `GameState` **by value** through the action + AI path:
//! `pre_action_state` (`server-core/session.rs`) and `boundary_snapshot`
//! (`game/engine.rs`, inside `apply_action_boundary_with_stack_limit`) are live
//! simultaneously, and the AI planner adds one live `Option<GameState>` per
//! search ply. A single `apply()` on a four-player Commander table therefore
//! keeps many `GameState` values alive on one frame chain, and inline size is
//! multiplied by every live slot.
//!
//! Overrunning that budget is **not** a catchable panic — Rust's stack-overflow
//! handler `abort()`s the process, which `panic = "unwind"` in
//! `[profile.server-release]` cannot contain. In production that means every
//! player at the table loses the game. So the compile-time ceilings in
//! `types/game_state_size.rs` are not sufficient on their own: this test pins
//! the *runtime* consequence of the layout, through the real `apply()`
//! pipeline.
//!
//! Shape adopted from `combo_infinite_pile.rs` (`thread::Builder` +
//! reach-guard). The explicit builder stack is what bounds the depth, so the
//! result is independent of libtest's `RUST_MIN_STACK`. Under nextest's
//! process-per-test isolation a guard-page abort stays attributable here.
//!
//! # Calibration
//!
//! Bisected against this exact fixture on a **debug** build
//! (nightly-2026-04-19, aarch64-apple-darwin), by reverting the boxing change
//! in the working tree and re-applying it:
//!
//! | layout | `size_of::<GameState>()` | this fixture needs | at 3 MiB |
//! |---|---:|---:|---|
//! | pre-fix (inline `ResolvedAbility`) | 30,112 B | > 3,328 KiB, <= 3,584 KiB | **abort** |
//! | post-fix (boxed) | 12,464 B | > 2,304 KiB, <= 2,560 KiB | **pass** |
//!
//! The table above is the upstream boxing calibration. The Patina old-border
//! fork was re-bisected after its current engine changes: this fixture aborts
//! at 3,072 KiB and passes at 3,328 KiB on the same M4 toolchain. The fork's
//! gate therefore uses 3,328 KiB below. This is a measured boundary, not a
//! reason to widen it again without repeating the bisection.
//!
//! **Read the ratio honestly.** `size_of::<GameState>()` fell by 2.42x, but
//! this fixture's stack high-water fell only ~1.36x. The high-water is
//! therefore **not** proportional to the struct size, and no claim in this file
//! depends on it being so.
//!
//! **The residual is not attributed.** Nobody has instrumented it, so treat the
//! following as ranked hypotheses, not findings:
//!
//!   1. **By-value `ResolvedAbility` parameters — a candidate that likely
//!      still size-scales.** This change boxed `ResolvedAbility` at every
//!      *storage* site but left the by-value *parameter* sites alone, and it
//!      unboxes into them at the call sites.
//!
//!      **Population and method, so the number can be re-derived rather than
//!      trusted:** `48` sites in `crates/`, counted as occurrences of
//!      `<ident>: ResolvedAbility` followed by `,` or `)` — i.e. the by-value
//!      spelling only, excluding `&`, `&mut`, `Box<>`, `Option<>` and `Vec<>`.
//!      That is 47 fn parameters plus 1 closure parameter
//!      (`game/effects/scoped_library_search.rs`), of which **13** are in
//!      `game/casting_costs.rs` and 6 are in test-only files. Zero are struct
//!      fields — this change boxed all of those, so this population is now
//!      purely parameters. Narrower scopes, for cross-checking: 46 under
//!      `crates/engine/src`.
//!
//!      Treat 48 as a **lower bound**: ripgrep undercounts this shape (macro
//!      sites, multi-line signatures), and rustc, not grep, is the
//!      authoritative census — the same argument this change makes for the
//!      retyping itself.
//!
//!      **Two other figures are in circulation; both reconcile, so do not
//!      "correct" this one to either.** PLAN-r4 §1.5 measured **49**
//!      crate-wide (48 fn + 1 closure) and listed `engine_stack.rs` among the
//!      sites — that is `finalize_trigger_target_selection`, whose parameter
//!      commit `5d0a2ab599` subsequently boxed. 49 - 1 = 48. PLAN-r4 also
//!      reports `casting_costs.rs` **x11**, against **13** here: its cluster
//!      counts only parameters *named* `ability`, and its eleven line numbers
//!      match those exactly; the extra two are `mut resolved: ResolvedAbility`
//!      at `:4352` and `:4664`. Same sites, different naming filter. The
//!      superseded "~33" that this comment used to carry matches neither and
//!      stated no population at all.
//!
//!      These nest on the path this very fixture drives: casting Murder reaches
//!      `casting_costs::check_additional_cost_or_pay` (`ability:
//!      ResolvedAbility`), which calls
//!      `check_additional_cost_or_pay_with_distribute` (also by value) — two
//!      live 5,264 B frames from one cast. `finish_pending_cast_cost_or_pay`
//!      takes one by value only to `Box::new` it immediately. So part of the
//!      remainder plausibly still scales with `ResolvedAbility`. This is the
//!      leading candidate, not a measured cause; an earlier claim that these
//!      sites cannot contribute was wrong, but "they dominate" is equally
//!      uninstrumented.
//!   2. Recursion depth and per-frame overhead that genuinely does not scale
//!      with any one type.
//!
//! Hypothesis 1 is a real follow-up with a measurable prize, not a dead end.
//! Instrument before acting on either.
//!
//! Because the window is a ~30% band rather than an order of magnitude, the
//! bound is deliberately taken near the top of it: that maximises post-fix
//! headroom while still going red pre-fix.
//!
//! # Why this test is gated to aarch64 macOS
//!
//! The discriminating window is `[2,560 KiB, 3,328 KiB]` — only ~30% wide — and
//! it was measured on **one** target: `aarch64-apple-darwin`. There is no safer
//! number available: going above 3,328 KiB makes the *pre-fix* layout pass too,
//! at which point the test stops discriminating and becomes decoration. So the
//! bound cannot be widened to absorb an unmeasured platform delta.
//!
//! Debug frame sizes are target-dependent (ABI, register pressure, spill
//! decisions), and `[profile.test]` inherits `dev`, so nothing is optimized
//! away. Running an uncalibrated bound does not fail politely: a stack overflow
//! `abort()`s, so the symptom is a **SIGABRT with no assertion message** on
//! whatever unrelated PR happens to be in the queue, and the documented remedy
//! ("re-run the bisection") is hours of work for someone with no context for
//! it.
//!
//! The `cfg` therefore matches the calibration on **both** axes. `target_arch =
//! "aarch64"` alone would be one axis too loose: it also admits
//! `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`, neither of which
//! was bisected. CI is `ubuntu-latest` (x86_64) today, so `target_arch` alone
//! happens to be inert there — but GitHub ships `ubuntu-*-arm` runners, and
//! moving CI onto one would silently start executing this uncalibrated. Pinning
//! `target_os = "macos"` as well means the gate can only ever run where the
//! number means something.
//!
//! To un-gate: run the same bisection on the new target, add its row to the
//! calibration table above, widen the `cfg` to admit it, and set
//! `BOUNDED_STACK_BYTES` from the *intersection* of all measured windows.
//! Cross-compiling is not enough — the bisection has to execute.
//!
//! # A better instrument exists — this gate is not the only option
//!
//! Recorded as a follow-up, deliberately not built here: **stack-painting
//! high-water measurement**. Spawn a thread with a known large stack, fill it
//! with a sentinel pattern, run the fixture, then scan for the deepest
//! disturbed byte. That yields a *number* rather than the survive/abort bit
//! this test produces, which means it (a) fails politely with "high-water
//! 2,410 KiB exceeds budget 3,072 KiB" instead of a bare SIGABRT, (b) runs on
//! every target, because the assertion is on the measured value rather than on
//! a target-calibrated bound, and (c) makes the 1.36x-vs-2.42x ratio above
//! *trackable over time* instead of something that has to be re-bisected by
//! hand. It is materially more work and needs care around what the OS actually
//! commits versus reserves. Do not read the `cfg` below as a claim that
//! target-gating was the only available design.
