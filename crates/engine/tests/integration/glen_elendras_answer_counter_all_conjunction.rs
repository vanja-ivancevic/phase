//! Glen Elendra's Answer — "Counter all spells your opponents control and all
//! abilities your opponents control. Create a 1/1 blue and black Faerie creature
//! token with flying for each spell and ability countered this way."
//!
//! Two production seams under test, both driven through the real cast pipeline
//! (`GameRunner::cast(..).resolve()`):
//!
//!   * PARSER (parser/oracle_effect/mod.rs, `try_parse_counter_all_conjunction`)
//!     — the "counter all A and all B" compound must lower to ONE
//!     `CounterAll { Or[spell-leg, ability-leg] }`, so the ability conjunct is
//!     actually countered at runtime instead of being dropped to
//!     `Effect::Unimplemented`.
//!   * ENGINE (game/effects/mod.rs, `affected_objects_from_events`) — the
//!     "for each spell AND ability countered this way" tracked set must read
//!     `SpellCountered` (CR 701.6a/113.9/608.2c), not `ZoneChanged`: a countered
//!     ability emits `SpellCountered` but no `ZoneChanged` (CR 405.1), so the
//!     old ZoneChanged-only path undercounted abilities.
//!
//! CR 113.9: activated/triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by
//! effects that specifically counter abilities. CR 608.2c: "for each spell and
//! ability countered this way" counts exactly the objects this instruction
//! countered.
//!
//! Test of Talents is verified UNAFFECTED: its
//! `FilteredTrackedSetSize { caused_by: Exiled }` excludes Counter members
//! because Test of Talents' counter carries no CR 614.1a exile rider, so
//! `this_way_cause_for_resolved` leaves its members unstamped (a counter WITH
//! that rider does stamp `Exiled` — issue #8762).
