/// (CR 120.3a — proof the chain reached the cast clause) and the MANDATORY
/// trailing instruction, "You put a card from among them that wasn't cast this
/// way into your hand", still moves the batch out of exile (CR 608.2c).

/// * Itazura's window does not currently open at all, for a reason that

///   was put on the stack, i.e. BEFORE this same trigger's own `ExileTop`
///   instruction ran — so the batch reads as empty and `cast_from_zone::resolve`
///   takes its no-targets exit. The trailing cleanup gets the batch right
///   because it binds to the resolution's tracked set (`TrackedSetFiltered`)
///   instead. Under the previous lowering the clause was equally dead (an empty
///   target list reached `grant_lingering_permissions` and stamped nothing) — it
///   merely also cost the controller a meaningless prompt, which is what this
///   change removes. Binding the cast anaphor to the tracked set is a separate
///   fix; the assertions below say the batch leaves exile without saying WHICH
///   mechanism offered it, so they will not need rewriting when that lands.

// one during resolution (CR 608.2g). The cards below EXILE first, and their
// "you may cast ..." instruction then offers that batch.
//
// CR 608.2g: for the FREE form (Epic Experiment, Collected Conjuring) the offer
// is a resolution-scoped `CastOfferKind::FreeCastWindow` opened while the source
// is still resolving — no casting permission is granted and no priority window
// is handed back, because "no other spells can normally be cast … during
// resolution" and the WotC rulings say the controller "can't wait to cast them
// later in the turn". For the PAID form (Sanwell, Avenger Ace) the controller
// must still be able to pay, so it stays a lingering
// `CastingPermission::ExileWithAltCost` (CR 118.9) observable on the
// legal-action surface at the next priority window. `free_cast_offers` reads
// whichever surface the card's own mechanism produced.
