//! Issue #2898: Najeela, the Blade-Blossom — the {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} activated
//! ability is parsed as a chained effect:
//!
//!   SetTapState(Untap, All, attacking creatures)
//!     -> GenericEffect (grant trample/lifelink/haste, affected: ParentTarget, UntilEndOfTurn)
//!       -> AdditionalPhase(Phase(Combat), after EndCombat)
//!
//! The reported bug: only the additional combat phase resolves — the untap and
//! the keyword grant chained ahead of `AdditionalPhase` are dropped. This is a
//! chained-effect completeness defect: when the head `SetTapState(All)` resolves
//! it must publish the affected creatures as the chain's tracked set so the
//! `affected: ParentTarget` keyword grant binds to them. This test drives the
//! exact parsed chain through `resolve_ability_chain` and asserts ALL THREE
//! sub-effects apply.
