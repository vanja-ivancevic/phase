//! Integration test for issue #340 — Greater Good's `cost_paid_object`
//! snapshot population through the real activation pipeline.
//!
//! Oracle (activated):
//!   "Sacrifice a creature: Draw cards equal to the sacrificed creature's
//!    power, then discard three cards."
//!
//! The draw count is `QuantityExpr::Ref(QuantityRef::Power { scope:
//! ObjectScope::CostPaidObject })`. The existing unit tests in `quantity.rs`
//! construct a `ResolvedAbility` with `cost_paid_object` already populated;
//! they never exercise the population path in `casting_costs.rs`. These tests
//! drive the **real** pipeline:
//!
//!   `GameAction::ActivateAbility` → `WaitingFor::SacrificeForCost`
//!   → `GameAction::SelectCards` → engine snapshots the victim's power into
//!   `cost_paid_object` BEFORE the zone change → resolve → draw N, discard 3.
//!
//! All cases drive `apply()` end-to-end, including the multi-permanent
//! (`count: 2`) sacrifice-cost tests at the end of the file.
//!
//! CR 400.7j + CR 608.2k: the sacrificed object's last-known information is
//! captured before it changes zones, so cost-paid-object property references
//! resolve at ability resolution.
//! CR 701.21: Sacrifice keyword action.
