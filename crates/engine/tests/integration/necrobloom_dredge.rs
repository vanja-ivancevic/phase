//! The Necrobloom — "Land cards in your graveyard have dredge 2." grants Dredge
//! to a card that never had it printed. Two independent engine defects compound:
//!
//! 1. Every candidate-discovery path for a Draw replacement sources candidates
//!    exclusively from `obj.replacement_definitions`, which is populated only by
//!    `synthesize_dredge` reading a PRINTED `Keyword::Dredge`. A land whose only
//!    Dredge is granted at runtime has an empty `replacement_definitions`, so it
//!    is never even offered.
//! 2. Every touch point that reads a candidate's mode / choice authority / execute
//!    effect / display label is borrow-based against that same stored field, so
//!    even a registered virtual candidate would fall through to generic,
//!    unlabeled defaults without its own touch-point branches.
//!
//! `crates/engine/src/game/replacement.rs` gained a new virtual-candidate family
//! (`GRANTED_DREDGE_INDEX` / `is_granted_dredge_replacement` /
//! `granted_dredge_value`) mirroring the existing `GrantedEtbKeyword` (printed-
//! vs-granted synthesis split) and `is_commander_hand_or_library_return_replacement`
//! (Optional, multi-touch-point virtual family) precedents, plus a shared
//! `database::synthesis::dredge_replacement_definition` builder extracted from
//! `synthesize_dredge` so printed and granted Dredge apply through the identical
//! definition shape.
//!
//! Candidate MULTIPLICITY — two or more candidates produced by one grant for a
//! single draw — is a first-class coverage axis of this module, not an edge
//! case: the grant's subject ("Land cards in your graveyard") is plural. It is
//! covered both ACROSS objects (several graveyard cards claiming one draw) and
//! ON A SINGLE OBJECT (one land carrying a printed Dredge alongside the granted
//! one — the board `granted_dredge_value`'s redundancy comparison exists for).
//!
//! These tests drive the real engine pipeline (`GameScenario` + `GameRunner`,
//! `DebugAction::DrawCards` → the real `start_draw_sequence` replacement pipeline,
//! `GameAction::ChooseReplacement`) with The Necrobloom's verbatim Oracle text —
//! no shape-only assertions.
//!
//! Oracle text verbatim from Scryfall (`mh3`, collector number 194):
//! "Landfall — Whenever a land you control enters, create a 0/1 green Plant
//! creature token. If you control seven or more lands with different names,
//! create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token instead.\nLand cards in your
//! graveyard have dredge 2. (You may return a land card from your graveyard to
//! your hand and mill two cards instead of drawing a card.)"
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//! - CR 702.52a: Dredge — instead of drawing, mill N and return this card from
//!   graveyard to hand.
//! - CR 702.52b: fewer than N library cards ⇒ dredge is not offered.
//! - CR 613.1f: Layer 6 ability-adding (keyword-granting) continuous effect.
//! - CR 611.3b: a static's continuous effect applies while its source is in the
//!   appropriate zone, even though its recipients (graveyard cards) are not.
//! - CR 614.6: a replaced event never happens — accepting dredge must not also
//!   draw.
//! - CR 616.1: two or more applicable replacement effects ⇒ the affected player
//!   chooses the order; each candidate must be distinguishably labeled.
//! - CR 109.4 + CR 108.4a: a graveyard object has no controller; use its owner.
