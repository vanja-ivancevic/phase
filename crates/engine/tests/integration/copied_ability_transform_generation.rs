//! CR 701.27f + CR 707.10: a COPY of an activated ability captures its source's
//! transformation generation at **copy-creation** time, not at the time the
//! original ability was put onto the stack.
//!
//! CR 701.27f: "If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent ... tries to
//! transform it, the permanent does so only if it hasn't transformed or
//! converted since the ability was put onto the stack." Copying such an ability
//! puts a NEW ability onto the stack (CR 707.10), so the copy's own
//! "since" boundary is the moment the copy was created.
//!
//! This is the discriminating test for `stack::push_copy_to_stack`, the
//! copy-onto-stack authority. It stamps the generation UNCONDITIONALLY, unlike
//! its put-onto-stack sibling `stack::push_to_stack`, which guards the stamp
//! with `is_none()` so that a delayed triggered ability's creation-time
//! generation survives firing. Applying that `is_none()` guard to a copy would
//! leave the copy carrying the ORIGINAL ability's older generation and silently
//! no-op — which is what this test's final assertion detects.
//!
//! Fixture cards (Oracle text verified against Scryfall):
//!   * Thraben Gargoyle // Stonewing Antagonizer — "Defender\n{6}: Transform
//!     this creature." An unconditional self-transform activated ability with no
//!     `{T}` in its cost, so it can be activated twice in one priority window.
//!   * Lithoform Engine — "{2}, {T}: Copy target activated or triggered ability
//!     you control. You may choose new targets for the copy."
//!
//! Thraben Gargoyle is printed as an Artifact Creature; this fixture builds it
//! as a plain creature because the CR 701.27f guard in `transform_effect.rs`
//! keys on `back_face` and `transformation_count`, never on card types.
//!
//! Stack ordering is the whole point. Activating in the order A1 → Lithoform
//! (targeting A1) → A2 makes the stack, bottom to top: [A1, COPY-ABILITY, A2].
//! Resolving LIFO:
//!   1. A2 transforms the Gargoyle — generation 0 -> 1.
//!   2. Lithoform copies A1 — the COPY is stamped at THIS moment.
//!   3. the COPY resolves — generation 1 -> 2, but only if it was stamped 1.
//!   4. A1 resolves — it is stamped 0 and the generation is now 2, so
//!      CR 701.27f correctly ignores it.
//!
//! Reverting `push_copy_to_stack` to the `is_none()`-guarded stamp leaves the
//! COPY carrying A1's generation 0 while the live generation is 1, so step 3
//! silently does nothing and the final count is 1 instead of 2.
