//! SHAPE: Matrix row 11 — the migrated card fixture must carry the correct
//! mana roles, not merely deserialize.
//!
//! CR 601.2c: a mana sentence's player target is either the RECIPIENT whose pool
//! receives the mana (CR 106.4) or the COUNT SOURCE the production's quantity
//! reads (CR 115.1). Jeska's Will's first mode persists a CountSource, while
//! Belbe persists a Recipient. The role is not recoverable from a bare
//! `TargetFilter`, so regeneration from the parser, which knows the role by
//! construction, is the correct migration.
