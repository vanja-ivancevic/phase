/// Row 1 — the headline regression: a mana-screwed AI must make its land drop.
///
/// **This test fails on unmodified main**, where a land on the battlefield
/// contributes 0.0 to every weighted feature while the same card in hand is worth
/// `+w_eff.hand_size`, making the evaluator score its own land drop as a strict
/// loss (up to −6.55 for Combo/late).
///
/// The `>= 2` `PlayLand` reach-guard is load-bearing. With exactly ONE playable
/// land, `prefer_land_drop` short-circuits before the search runs, which is why
/// `scenarios.rs::scenario_single_playable_land_uses_deterministic_shortcut`
/// passed throughout the bug's lifetime. Two lands force the shortcut to decline
/// and hand the decision to the scored path.
///
/// **Diagnostic**: the guard proves the shortcut *declines*, not that the
/// evaluator is *reached*. `fast_priority_action` runs at both `choose_action`
/// and the top of `score_candidates_core` and carries further shortcuts. If this
/// goes red, check `fast_priority_action` before suspecting the offset.
///
/// # Why this asserts a SCORE ORDERING and not a sampled action
///
/// Measured on this exact fixture: `PlayLand` scores **2.333 against
/// `PassPriority` 3.272 with the offset disabled** (the bug — passing outranks
/// the land drop) and **9.833 against 9.755 with it enabled**. The ordering flips,
/// which is the whole fix, and asserting it is deterministic.
///
/// The surviving margin is only **+0.078**, far below the raw +7.5 eval delta,
/// and that compression is real rather than a fixture artifact: `PassPriority` in
/// a precombat main phase does **not** forfeit the land drop, so the continuation
/// search sees both lines converge on "the land gets played" and correctly scores
/// them as nearly equivalent. At T = 0.5 that leaves a sampled `choose_action`
/// call close to a coin flip, so a sampled assertion here would be a flaky test
/// pinning the rng rather than the behaviour. See the implementation report: this
/// compression falsifies the plan's risk-10.13 claim that the offset outranks the
/// entire policy layer on an ordinary priority decision.
