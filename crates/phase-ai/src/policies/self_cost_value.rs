//! Net-value gate policy for self-cost ability activations.
//!
//! Thin adapter over `self_cost.rs`: fetches the activated ability, confirms its
//! cost spends a self-resource (sacrifice / pay-life / discard / self-exile),
//! stands down when off-ability deck synergy justifies the cost, then prices the
//! cost against the ability's immediate payoff. A real cost with a trivial
//! payoff is rejected (scoring `-inf`, so Pass wins); a cheap cost is merely
//! deprioritized; a payoff that can be confidently and completely priced is
//! compared against the cost — and a payoff **certified smaller than the cost is
//! rejected**, not discounted — and a real payoff that cannot be soundly priced
//! (unpriceable effect, or an unmodeled rider in the chain) is left alone.
//!
//! This policy is the **single authority** for the cost-vs-benefit question on
//! every self-cost activation, mana-costed sacrifice outlets included.
//!
//! # Why the underwater arm is categorical and not graduated
//!
//! An earlier revision scored the underwater case in proportion to the
//! shortfall, on the argument that search should stay able to override it. That
//! was **falsified by measurement** (see `policies::tests::sac_outlet_drain_repro`
//! for the executed record). The final decision is a softmax *sample*
//! (`search::softmax_select_pairs`) at Medium `temperature = 1.0`, repeated over
//! ~100 priority windows per game: repricing a repeatable outlet from `+0.85` to
//! `-0.65` cut the per-window activation probability 63.9% → 28.3%, a real 2.3×
//! improvement, and the board drained **identically**, because P(at least one
//! selection over that many windows) ≈ 1.0 either way.
//!
//! The general law, worth carrying to any policy verdict on a *repeatable*
//! candidate: **a graduated penalty is a rate, a `Reject` is a bound, and a rate
//! cannot enforce a bound over unbounded trials.** Only `-inf` is categorical —
//! its softmax weight is `exp(-inf) = 0`. So a graduated "discouragement" on a
//! trade this policy has certified as a loss means "do it eventually", which is
//! the opposite of what the certification says.
//!
//! # Why the trivial-payoff bound is a life COUNT and not a price
//!
//! The law above says a bound cannot be enforced by a rate — but stating a bound
//! still requires choosing the unit it is expressed in, and for the trivial
//! branch that unit is the resource, not its price.
//!
//! `self_cost::real_self_cost` prices pay-life at `points *
//! self_cost_pay_life_per_point` (0.15/point), multiplied by 4.0 only when life
//! is already a pressured resource. An unpressured Adanto Vanguard ("Pay 4 life:
//! this creature gains indestructible until end of turn") therefore prices at
//! 0.60, under `REAL_COST_FLOOR`, and lands on the graduated `self_cost_marginal`
//! branch — a −0.60 rate against an ability that can be activated in every
//! priority window, which is exactly the shape the law above forbids. Raising
//! `self_cost_pay_life_per_point` until 4 life clears the floor would reach that
//! case, but only by moving every *priced* comparison a life leg participates in
//! (the `Priced` arm's net, every mixed-cost outlet boundary) — a measured AI
//! behaviour change that needs an ai-gate calibration to justify.
//!
//! The veto side needs no calibration at all, because it never compares against
//! a benefit: the payoff has already been certified trivial. So the question it
//! asks is the one the player actually faces — **is this at least
//! `self_cost_material_life` life?** A count is the right unit for the same
//! reason `-inf` is the right verdict: the answer must not move when the rate
//! moves, and must not drift when CMA-ES retrains the per-point price.
//!
//! **The veto fires only on a Trivial-proper chain**
//! (`BenefitAppraisal::Trivial { any_unmodeled: false }`), where every effect
//! was explicitly classified trivial. A chain carrying an unmodeled effect —
//! `Effect::Pump` among them, so the whole Desolation Prowler class ("Pay 2
//! life: this creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn") — reports "no payoff" only
//! as an absence of evidence, so it keeps the graduated branch. Its activation
//! *timing* is a separate policy's job, not this one's.
