//! Self-funded untap-loop veto (Basalt Monolith / Grim Monolith class).
//!
//! Report (Discord threads 1542264507844395078, 1543494524654059560,
//! 1544378844516065441 — "interaction spam"): the AI activates Basalt
//! Monolith's `{3}: Untap Basalt Monolith` on an *already untapped* Monolith,
//! four or five priority passes in a row. Grim Monolith is the same shape at
//! `{4}`.
//!
//! Mechanism. The card parses as two activated abilities: `{T}: Add {C}{C}{C}`
//! (a mana ability) and `{3}: Untap this` (a normal activated ability). Only
//! the second is ever a priority candidate — CR 605.3b, a mana ability doesn't
//! use the stack, so the tap half is not emitted as an `ActivateAbility`
//! decision. When the source is untapped at announcement the untap can add
//! nothing: it is already untapped. Payment then comes from the engine's
//! auto-tap, which may legally tap the source itself for its own untap
//! (CR 605.3a — a mana ability may be activated while paying a cost). Tap for
//! {C}{C}{C}, spend {3}, untap: the board is byte-identical and the mana pool
//! empties (CR 106.4). Net zero, repeated every pass.
//!
//! Why a `Reject` and not a graded penalty. `redundancy_avoidance`'s
//! `untap_redundancy` arm already scores this shape −3.0 and the loop persists:
//! under the softmax a graduated penalty is a *rate*, and only `Reject` (mapped
//! to `NEG_INFINITY` by `PolicyRegistry::score`) is a bound. Both fire on the
//! untapped shape; `Reject` dominates. That policy's arms model "this effect is
//! a no-op on its targets" and return summed deltas — the right home for a
//! categorical veto is a policy of its own.
//!
//! The sole veto is "source untapped at announcement". A *tapped* in-class
//! source is explicitly NOT vetoed — paying idle land mana at an opponent's end
//! step (mana that CR 106.4 would empty anyway) to have the rock available next
//! turn is the correct line for a rock that does not untap normally. Nor is
//! there any need to ask whether a tapped source could only fund its own untap:
//! the engine already answers that. The only battlefield `ActivateAbility`
//! emission path (`candidates.rs` → `can_activate_ability_now_with_restriction_gates`
//! → `can_pay_ability_cost_now`) requires the cost to be payable, and a tapped
//! source cannot tap itself for mana — so any tapped in-class candidate is
//! payable from elsewhere by construction. An affordability re-check here would
//! be a tautology costing one state clone per candidate; do not re-add one.
//!
//! Because the veto is categorical, the stand-downs are load-bearing. They are
//! written against payoff *shapes*, not a card list: an activation-cost
//! reduction static (the untap stops being net-zero), a tap / untap /
//! activation trigger on our own board (the loop becomes a payoff engine —
//! Forsaken Monument, Kinnan, Rings of Brighthearth), and a source whose
//! untapping restores a real use (a creature, or another non-mana ability with
//! a tap cost). Known gap: an own-board mana-doubling `ProduceMana` replacement
//! (Nyxbloom Ancient, Mana Reflection) also makes the loop net-positive and is
//! not yet a stand-down; the tapped-state continuation of that line stays
//! neutral, so only starting it from untapped is foreclosed.
//!
//! Perf: untap-self activations are rare candidates. Predicates run card-local
//! first (root-effect match, then mana-source and cost checks on the candidate's
//! own object), then the O(1) static-presence index, and only then a single
//! battlefield trigger walk — reached only once the class is confirmed. No
//! affordability sweep, no `find_legal_targets`, no state clone.
