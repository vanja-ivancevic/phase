//! `MulliganCardFloor` — the single authority for the AI's minimum kept-hand
//! size. Applies to every deck in every format.
//!
//! CR 103.5 defines the mulligan process and, in its final sentence, permits
//! a player to "take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards."
//! The rules therefore impose NO minimum kept-hand size above zero — the
//! floor below is an AI *strategy* heuristic bounding that process, not a
//! rules requirement. CR 103.5c supplies the free-first-mulligan discount,
//! consumed here via `kept_hand_size_after`.
//!
//! Without this floor an ordinary deck can chain-mulligan toward a zero-card
//! opening hand by two independent routes:
//!   1. an unbounded `ForceMulligan` from `KeepablesByLandCount`, and
//!   2. a negative additive total from the archetype policies, none of which
//!      consult `mulligans_taken` — so the acceptance threshold never relaxes
//!      with depth and the mulligan chain is geometric, with a fat tail at the
//!      engine's `MAX_MULLIGANS` cap.
//!
//! `ForceKeep` outranks both in `MulliganRegistry`'s three-way precedence, so a
//! single floor closes both routes for hands that retain a bounded opening
//! action. A certified dead landless hand is the deliberate exception: it keeps
//! the existing force-mulligan path instead of receiving a floor override.
