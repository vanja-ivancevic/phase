//! `FixedDeckKeepMulligan` — force-keep for engine-supplied fixed decks.
//!
//! CR 103.5: a player mulligans to find a workable opening hand. That premise
//! assumes a varied deck where some hands are better than others. The Momir
//! family of formats inverts it: the engine supplies a fixed 60-card
//! all-basic-land deck (`FormatConfig:: supplies_fixed_deck`) and the entire
//! game plan is the command-zone emblem (`{X}, Discard a card: create a random
//! creature token`). Every legal hand is seven lands, and one seven-land hand
//! is as good as any other — there is nothing to mulligan *toward*.
//!
//! Without this force-keep, the deck-agnostic `KeepablesByLandCount` policy
//! reads an all-land / no-spell hand as unkeepable, force-mulligans every
//! redraw to the maximum (CR 103.5 final sentence), and bottoms the AI down to
//! a zero-card opening hand. This policy emits `ForceKeep`, which outranks every
//! `ForceMulligan` in the registry's three-way precedence, whenever the format
//! supplies a fixed deck. Non-fixed-deck formats abstain with a neutral
//! additive score, exactly as the archetype keepables do when not applicable.
