//! Hard-veto gate for casting/activating an {X}-cost spell or ability whose
//! only affordable X is 0 and whose payoff scales with X — a guaranteed no-op.
//!
//! Issue: the AI commits to `GameAction::CastSpell` / `ActivateAbility` at the
//! `WaitingFor::Priority` seam, *before* X is chosen (X is announced downstream
//! at `WaitingFor::ChooseXValue`, CR 601.2b/f). When the only value the AI can
//! afford is X=0, nothing rejects the commitment, so it casts Exsanguinate for 0
//! (draining no life), pumps Helix Pinnacle by 0 counters, wipes its own board
//! to 0/0 with Mirror Entity, etc. `XValuePolicy` cannot help — it only scores
//! the `ChooseX` candidates *after* the cast is already committed.
//!
//! This gate rejects the pre-cast commitment when three things hold:
//! 1. the cost carries an `{X}` mana shard,
//! 2. `casting_costs::max_x_value` (the engine's single X-affordability
//!    authority, CR 601.2b/f) reports the only legal X is 0, and
//! 3. the payoff genuinely scales with X (via `x_reference`, the shared
//!    detector the ramp policy also consumes), with any *fixed* non-X residual
//!    still being trivial (classified by
//!    `self_cost::residual_effects_are_trivial_at_x_zero`).
//!
//! Rejecting the cast makes the AI `Pass` (always a Priority candidate) and hold
//! the card — it never loses the card, it just waits until X≥1 is affordable.
//! Build for the class, not the card: every rule 1–3 match is gated regardless
//! of card name; fixed-payoff {X} cards (whose payoff does not reference X) are
//! structurally spared.
