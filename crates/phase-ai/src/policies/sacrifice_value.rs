/// Max expected magnitude of [`SacrificeValuePolicy::score`] — the point past
/// which [`rescale_into_critical_band`] starts to saturate; below it, ordering
/// is preserved exactly.
///
/// **Why this policy needs a ceiling at all.** `score` is a *sum over the
/// selection*, so its range scales with cardinality while a single verdict is
/// clamped at [`CRITICAL_MAX`](super::registry::CRITICAL_MAX) = 15.0. Routing
/// the raw sum through `PolicyVerdict::score` alone therefore **saturates**:
/// every magnitude past `STRONG_MAX` collapses onto one value and the top of
/// the distribution flattens. Two distinct sacrifices then score identically
/// and the stable sort — enumeration order — picks between them.
///
/// **Derived from the measured card pool, not from a formula.** Population:
/// the 19,318 printed creatures in `client/public/card-data.json` with fixed
/// power and toughness. `eval::creature_combat_value` is `1.5 * power +
/// toughness`, so that distribution *is* this policy's range for the dominant
/// case — a one-card creature sacrifice, which is what 58 of the pool's
/// additional-cost sacrifice spells and effectively every `WardSacrificeChoice`
/// ask for:
///
/// | percentile | `1.5p + t` |
/// |---|---|
/// | p50   |  6.0 |
/// | p90   | 12.5 |
/// | p95   | **15.0 — exactly `CRITICAL_MAX`** |
/// | p99   | 20.0 |
/// | p99.9 | 30.0 |
///
/// The p95 row is the defect in one line: under a bare clamp the top **5.15%**
/// of printed bodies (995 of 19,318) are indistinguishable from each other at a
/// *single-card* selection. A vanilla 6/6 is `6*1.5 + 6 = 15.0` and already
/// sits on the ceiling. This constant is p99.9, so ordering is exact for all
/// but the top 0.1% (28 cards).
///
/// **The price, stated so a maintainer can act on it rather than rediscover
/// it.** Rescaling is not free: every magnitude above `STRONG_MAX` is
/// compressed *relative to sibling policies* in `PolicyRegistry`'s sum. At this
/// ceiling a raw 15.0 reaches the registry as 9.0, and a raw 10.0 as 7.0. A
/// ceiling of 21.0 would give 11.25 and 8.12 — but it collapses the
/// two-creature costs (Bankrupt in Blood, Phyrexian Tribute) as soon as the two
/// bodies sum past 21, which two p90 creatures already do. Lower it if the AI
/// is measured under-valuing expensive sacrifices; raise it if multi-card
/// sacrifices are measured being chosen arbitrarily. Either way it owes a
/// paired-seed `scripts/ai-gate.sh` run — see `strategy_helpers::sacrifice_cost`.
///
/// **What still saturates, named rather than left to be discovered.** Gaea's
/// Balance (*"sacrifice five lands"*) reaches 45.0 at this policy's own
/// `PayCost { Sacrifice }` state. Its selection is all-land (`type_filters:
/// ["Land"], count: 5`, verified in `data/card-data.json`), so the per-land
/// guard is a constant offset across every candidate set and cannot invert;
/// what is lost is `-total_cost` ordering *among* lands, which matters only
/// when a creature-land is in the pool.
/// `rescale_into_critical_band`'s own docstring places exactly this in "the
/// extreme tail, where ordering no longer matters".
///
/// Tectonic Split (*"sacrifice half the lands you control"*) was previously
/// named here as a second, *unbounded* all-land case. **Both halves of that
/// were wrong** and it is recorded rather than quietly dropped, because the
/// mistake is the kind a re-derivation would repeat: it parses to
/// `count: 1` with an **empty** `type_filters` (verified in
/// `data/card-data.json`), so it is bounded at one card and its pool is
/// *mixed* — every permanent matches. The guard is therefore live and useful
/// there, not lost. (The parse is a pre-existing parser defect — the Oracle
/// text is a dynamic count over lands — and is out of scope here.)
///
/// Pinned by `sacrifice_value_ceiling_pins_the_compression_it_costs` (the
/// figures above) and `verdict_preserves_the_land_guard_where_a_bare_clamp_collapses_it`

    /// 1. **Shape.** `sacrifice_key`/`cmp_sacrifice` are a per-object sort key

    ///    a *set* (`SelectCards { cards }`), reduces it to one `f64`, and the
    ///    registry ranks candidate sets by softmax. A comparator does not
    ///    substitute into a set reduction.
    /// 2. **Range.** A tier is lexicographic, so encoding one additively needs a
    ///    band exceeding every achievable scalar. `sacrifice_cost` is unbounded
    ///    above (`evaluate_creature` is `power * 1.5 + toughness + bonuses`,
    ///    unclamped), while this verdict is clamped to
    ///    [`CRITICAL_MAX`](super::registry::CRITICAL_MAX) — deliberately, and
    ///    pinned by `large_sacrifice_stays_within_critical_band` (issue #4282).
    ///    `PolicyRegistry::verdicts` additionally tripwires out-of-band literals.
    ///    So a dominating band is not merely discouraged here, it is
    ///    inexpressible.
    ///
    /// The bounded penalty is the codebase's established answer to this exact
    /// shape — compare `cycling_needed_land_penalty` ("occupies the finite
    /// strong band") and `payment_selection_needed_land_penalty`, both finite
    /// land guards inside set-summing policy scores.
    ///
    /// **What it does and does not guarantee.** Its magnitude strictly exceeds
    /// `NONCREATURE_SACRIFICE_CAP`, so a land is never given up ahead of any
    /// *non-creature* permanent — **for selections whose raw magnitude stays
    /// within `SACRIFICE_VALUE_RAW_CEILING`**. At the shipped defaults, that
    /// means every all-non-creature selection containing no owned commander up
    /// to **seven** cards. With one owned commander whose `sacrifice_cost` is
    /// `C`, the bound is instead `ceil((34 - C) / 4) - 1`: **five** cards for
    /// the canonical `{3}{W}` Vehicle commander cast once (`C = 10.0`), and
    /// **three** for a high-tax ten-drop (`C = 20.0`). There is deliberately no
