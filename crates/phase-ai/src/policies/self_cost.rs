//! Net-value gate for self-cost ability activations.
//!
//! An activated ability whose *cost* spends the AI's own resources — it
//! sacrifices a permanent, pays life, discards, or exiles cards from the AI's
//! own hand/graveyard — should only be activated when its *effect* buys
//! something worth the loss. The free-outlet policy only prices creature
//! sacrifice for aristocrats outlets; land-sacrifice lifegain (Zuran Orb),
//! pay-life pingers, discard-to-grant loops, and self-exile-from-graveyard
//! grants all slip past it, so the AI cracks them every turn for nothing.
//!
//! This module is the single authority that (1) recognizes those four cost
//! shapes on the `AbilityCost` tree, (2) prices the self-inflicted cost, and
//! (3) decides whether the ability's immediate payoff is trivial, and prices
//! the payoffs it can price confidently (draws, out-of-pressure lifegain) for
//! the net-value comparison — a draw the policy can classify as **AI-only**
//! is priced only when the engine can complete an exact present-state
//! draw-delivery preview. An exact partial or zero delivery is priced exactly;
//! a replacement order, optional replacement, or continuation-owned choice is
//! `Unpriced` and therefore leaves the comparison neutral. Only AI-only
//! recipients are previewed — mixed-recipient draws are `Unpriced`, while
//! opponent-only draws are trivial churn.
//!
//! It is deliberately conservative: anything whose
//! payoff scales or is ambiguous — mana production, land search, large or
//! power-derived damage, beneficial counters — is treated as non-trivial, so
//! ramp, fixing, burn finishers, and counter payoffs are never suppressed.
//! That conservatism is typed as [`BenefitAppraisal::Unpriced`], which covers
//! both a non-trivial effect with no confident price and an unmodeled rider
//! sitting beside a priced effect — in either case no directional conclusion
//! about the trade is sound, so the comparison stands down. Off-ability
//! synergy for a resource that is actually spent (a lifegain/reanimator shell)
//! stands the gate down entirely. A sacrifice is never a generic discount:
//! death-trigger value must be represented by the activated ability's real
//! payoff before it can outweigh that cost.
//!
//! Cost-vs-benefit for a self-cost activation is answered **here and only
//! here**: `FreeOutletActivationPolicy` scores aristocrats death-trigger
//! payoff presence for free outlets and holds no cost authority.
//!
//! Only the *scoring* half lives here; the thin `SelfCostValuePolicy` adapter
//! (`self_cost_value.rs`) fetches the activated ability and turns these
//! predicates into a `PolicyVerdict`.
