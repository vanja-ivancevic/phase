//! Regression snapshot for `effect_classify::effect_polarity`.
//!
//! `effect_polarity` was made exhaustive over `Effect` (the trailing `_ =>
//! Contextual` wildcard was replaced with an explicit enumeration of every
//! formerly-unclassified variant, all mapped to `Contextual`). Two guards
//! protect that change:
//!
//! 1. **Compile-time exhaustiveness** — because the wildcard is gone, a newly
//!    added `Effect` variant fails to compile in `effect_polarity` until it is
//!    deliberately classified. That is the forcing function; it cannot be a
//!    runtime assertion (there is no `EnumIter` on `Effect`).
//! 2. **This snapshot** — locks the concrete classifications so a future edit
//!    that accidentally moves a `Beneficial`/`Harmful` variant into the
//!    Contextual bulk (or vice versa) fails. Constructing all 210 variants is
//!    impractical without `EnumIter`, so this samples representatives of every
//!    polarity outcome, both branch-dependent variants (`ChangeZone`,
//!    `SetTapState`), and a spread of formerly-wildcarded variants now proven
//!    to return `Contextual`.
