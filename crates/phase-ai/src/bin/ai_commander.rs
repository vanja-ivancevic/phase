//! Sanity-check runner: four-player commander game driven entirely by the AI.
//!
//! Loads four commander precons from `feeds/commander-precons.json`, sets up
//! a 4-player commander GameState, and drives every player with the native
//! AI until the game ends (or an action budget is hit). Reports per-turn
//! life totals and the final outcome.
//!
//! Usage (pod-lab loop-3 Q5): `--profile server-release`, not plain
//! `--release` -- `[profile.release]` (workspace `Cargo.toml`) sets `panic =
//! 'abort'` (it exists to keep the WASM build small), which silently defeats
//! `run_batch_isolated`'s `catch_unwind`-based per-game panic isolation
//! below: under `abort`, one game's panic takes the whole batch process down
//! instead of being caught and reported. `server-release` inherits `release`
//! but overrides `panic = 'unwind'` for exactly this reason.
//!   cargo run --profile server-release --bin ai-commander -- client/public
//!   cargo run --profile server-release --bin ai-commander -- client/public --seed 7 --difficulty Easy
//!   cargo run --profile server-release --bin ai-commander -- client/public --difficulty Easy \
//!       --difficulty-p2 VeryHard --action-cap 50000
//!
//! Batch mode (pod-lab simulation-acceleration plan, Tier 1 item 1): play many
//! games in one process instead of one process per game, amortizing the card
//! database load (~1.8s/game measured) across the whole batch. `--games-file`
//! points at a file of `seed,difficulty` lines (one game per line); when it is
//! given, `--seed`/`--difficulty` are ignored and every line is played in turn
//! against the SAME loaded database and feed. Each game's play-through is
//! panic-isolated (`run_batch_isolated`) and its result is flushed to stdout
//! immediately, so a batch survives an individual game panicking or the whole
//! process being killed mid-batch (pod-lab enforces an external wall-clock
//! timeout on the process) -- but only under a `panic = 'unwind'` profile;
//! see the note above.
//!   cargo run --profile server-release --bin ai-commander -- client/public --games-file games.txt
//!
//! Optional engagement telemetry: repeat `--watch-card "Exact Name, With Comma"`
//! for exact, case-sensitive names. Legacy `--watch-cards "Name One,Name Two"`
//! still splits on commas. Both options trim surrounding whitespace. The last
//! legacy list plus all exact names are watched.
//! `PODLAB-TELEM` retains the sorted global draw/cast union `cards_seen` and adds
//! `card_counts`: rows sorted by numeric `seat`, then `name`, with numeric `draws`
//! and `casts`. Only observed, name-resolved draw/cast events produce rows; these
//! are event counts, not evidence of resolution or a win-condition activation.

// pod-lab loop-3 Q5: native-binary throughput lever, gated in Cargo.toml so
// wasm32 builds of this crate's lib (pulled in by engine-wasm/draft-wasm)
// never see it.
