//! Graveyard card-type-diversity feature — the delirium / descend / Goyf axis.
//!
//! Parser AST verification — VERIFIED against engine source:
//! - `QuantityRef::DistinctCardTypes { source: CardTypeSetSource }` at
//!   `crates/engine/src/types/ability.rs:5565` (CR 205.2a card types).
//! - `CardTypeSetSource::Zone { zone: ZoneRef, scope: CountScope }` at
//!   `crates/engine/src/types/ability.rs:5272` (CR 109.2a + CR 400.1) — the
//!   graveyard scoping used by every card in this class.
//! - Threshold payoffs carry `StaticCondition::QuantityComparison { lhs, comparator,
//!   rhs }` whose `lhs` is that quantity (Backwoods Survivalists, Autumnal Gloom).
//! - Scaling payoffs read the same quantity as a dynamic magnitude with no
//!   threshold at all (Consuming Blob's `SetDynamicPower`).
//! - Enablers: `Effect::Mill`, `Effect::Discard`, `Effect::DiscardCard`,
//!   `Effect::Surveil`, and `Effect::Dig { rest_destination: Graveyard }` —
//!   classified by the shared `reanimator::effect_fills_own_graveyard`
//!   authority, and read from BOTH `abilities` and `triggers[*].execute`.
//!
//! No parser remediation required.
//!
//! ## Why this axis exists
//!
//! CR 207.2c lists delirium, descend, threshold and undergrowth as **ability
//! words** — they have no rules meaning, so the mechanical content is entirely
//! the underlying "N or more card types among cards in your graveyard"
//! condition. 95 cards in the corpus read that quantity, and nothing in the AI
//! modelled graveyard type-diversity as a resource: a self-mill that turns a
//! delirium payoff on scored exactly the same as one that did not.
//!
//! ## Boundary with `reanimator`
//!
//! `reanimator` detects graveyard *recursion targets* — what is worth bringing
//! back. This axis measures the *type spread* of the graveyard, which is a
//! different resource: a graveyard of four creatures is excellent for
//! reanimator and useless for delirium. The axes are independent by design.
