//! Determinized opponent sampling for the AI planning path.
//!
//! The engine's authoritative `GameState` carries every player's *real* hidden
//! zones (hand + library). If the AI search reads them during simulation it is
//! cheating with perfect information. This module produces an
//! **AI-simulation-only** clone in which every opponent's genuinely-unknown
//! hidden-zone cards are resampled to a plausible assignment consistent with
//! public information + the sanctioned `deck_knowledge` model + engine reveal
//! sets. The untouched beam/rollout search then runs on the sampled state, and
//! the ensemble wrapper (`search::score_candidates_with_session`) averages
//! across K samples.
//!
//! CR 400.2 (hand and library are hidden zones), CR 401.2 (library order is
//! unknown), CR 401.3 / CR 402.1 (library and hand SIZE are public — preserved
//! exactly), CR 701.20a (revealed cards are known to all players — pinned),
//! CR 701.20e (a looked-at card is known only to the looking player).
//!
//! # Why the AI's own zones are never resampled
//!
//! Determinization leaves the AI player's OWN hand/library — and all public
//! zones — **byte-identical**. This is what makes own-hidden-zone candidate
//! enumeration safe: candidate generators that read the AI's own hidden cards by
//! identity (e.g. `card_name_choice_candidates`, `candidates.rs:4053`, or any
//! cast-from-hand enumeration) see exactly the real cards, so the K sampled
//! worlds share an identical AI-legal-action set. Only cards the AI cannot
//! legitimately know are swapped, which is precisely the set no AI candidate can
//! reference by identity (see the pin-invariant in `search.rs`).
//!
//! # Identity-swap caveat (residual fields not rewritten by the primitive)
//!
//! `apply_card_face_to_object` (the engine's in-place face-application
//! primitive) overwrites the castability-relevant characteristics —
//! `name`, `power`/`toughness`/`loyalty`/`defense` (+ `base_*` mirrors),
//! `card_types`, `mana_cost`, `keywords`, `abilities`/`triggers`/`replacements`/
//! `static_definitions` (+ `base_*`), `color`, `printed_ref`/`base_printed_ref`,
//! `casting_restrictions`, `casting_options`, `modal`, `additional_cost`,
//! `strive_cost`, `cleave_variant`, `spellbook`, and (conditionally)
//! `class_level`/`intensity`/`case_state`/`room_unlocks`/`attraction_lights`. It
//! also sets `base_characteristics_initialized = true`. It does NOT rewrite the
//! following residual fields, each verified inert in the v1 score path:
//!
//! | Residual field | Why inert in the v1 score path |
//! |---|---|
//! | `card_id` | The score path performs zero `card_id`-keyed `CardDatabase` lookups; cast actions read the object's (overwritten) characteristics self-consistently, so a stale id never resolves the object back to its real identity. A `debug_assert` below documents this invariant. |
//! | `back_face` | Needs a `CardDatabase` rehydrate not threaded into scoring; front-face cost/abilities are correct, alternate-face casting stays inert (P6-followup-B). |
//! | `perpetual_mods` / `intensity` | Persist across hidden zones by explicit engine design (`game_object.rs`); zeroing them would fight that invariant. Rare (digital-only Alchemy), not read by hidden-zone candidate gen/eval in v1. |
//! | `counters` / `stickers` | Not carried by hidden-zone cards in normal play; candidate gen/eval read them only for battlefield permanents. |
//! | `casting_permissions` | Governs whether a specific object may be cast; no AI candidate references a resampled unknown card by identity (pin-invariant), so a stale permission cannot enable an illegal cheat candidate. |
//!
//! # Shipping status (2026-07-18)
//!
//! All difficulty tier presets ship `determinization_samples = 0`
//! (perfect-information search) as a deliberate strength decision while players
//! win ~80% of games vs the AI. This module remains the config-reachable
//! sampling primitive for experiments and measurement runs — reached by setting
//! `SearchConfig::determinization_samples > 0` directly — and is exercised by the
//! `search.rs` ensemble tests, which set K manually.
