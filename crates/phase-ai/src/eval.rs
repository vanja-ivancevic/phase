///
/// Note the ordering that the "Control inverts" framing hides: **Midrange is the

/// `#[default]` — the classification every unplaceable deck falls back to.
///
/// Combo and Ramp have no rock-vs-body row. Combo is the archetype with the

///
/// # The premium applies symmetrically to LOSING a source
///
/// `BoardStats::mana_sources` is recomputed live from the battlefield, so a
/// source that leaves moves the differential by one and takes its `C` with it.
/// Where that can actually change a decision is
/// narrower than "any board loss", so name the mechanism rather than the
/// situation. The offset has exactly two consumers: `evaluate_state_breakdown`
/// (whence `EvaluationBreakdown::total` feeds
/// `PlannerServices::evaluate_with_strategy`) and `FeatureRow::extract` (a
/// harvested control column the trainer discards). It can therefore move a
/// choice ONLY through the search leaf eval, i.e. only when
/// `config.search.enabled`; the heuristic-only branch of `score_candidates_core`
/// ranks with `PlannerServices::tactical_score` (`should_play_now_with_facts`
/// plus the policy registry), and no file under `policies/` references
/// `evaluate_state`.
///
/// Resolve that bound rather than leaving it as a condition, because "only when
/// search is enabled" reads as a narrow restriction and is not one. In
/// `config::create_config`, `search.enabled` is `false` for **`VeryEasy` and
/// `Easy`** and `true` for **`Medium`, `Hard`, `VeryHard`, and `CEDH`** — so the
/// *preset* bound means *Medium and above*, and since `AiConfig::default` is
/// `create_config(AiDifficulty::Medium, Platform::Native)`, the **default
/// difficulty does see this offset**.
///
/// The presets are not the whole set, and the remainder inverts that answer for a
/// 5- or 6-player pod at `<= Medium`. Read the regime the way `policies::loop_shortcut`
/// already enumerates it — search is off for VeryEasy / Easy, **for large pods at
/// `<= Medium`**, for `SearchConfig::default()`, and for a pre-expired deadline:
///
/// - `config::create_config_for_players` forces `search.enabled = false` when
///   `player_count` is **5 or more** and `config.difficulty <= AiDifficulty::Medium`
///   — `AiDifficulty` derives `Ord` in declaration order, so that set is exactly
///   `VeryEasy`, `Easy`, `Medium`. This is the constructor the production entry
///   points use on **every platform, the browser included**: `engine-wasm`'s AI
///   entry points call `create_config_for_players(ai_difficulty, Platform::Wasm,
///   state.players.len() as u8)`, and `phase_server` / `server_core::session` pass the
///   live lobby count. So on a **5- or 6-player pod at `<= Medium`, the default
///   difficulty included, this offset is inert.** The boundary falls *above* the
///   ordinary 4-player Commander table: the `3..=4` arm rescales
///   `max_depth`, `max_nodes`, `max_branching`, and `rollout_depth` only and never
///   writes `enabled`, and `create_config`'s `Platform::Wasm` block clamps the same
///   budget knobs and no more — so **4 players at Medium on any platform keeps
///   `enabled: true` and does see the offset.** The match arm is unbounded above
///   (`_`), but `FormatConfig::commander` is `min_players: 2, max_players: 6`, so
///   for Commander the inert band is exactly `{5, 6}` of `{2..=6}` — the two
///   largest pods the format admits.
/// - `SearchConfig::default()` is `enabled: false`, but no shipped difficulty
///   preset uses it.
/// - A **pre-expired deadline** breaks `score_candidates_core`'s iterative
///   deepening at the rung-0 entry guard and returns the tactical-only floor, so
///   no leaf eval runs and the offset is absent there too — at *any* difficulty.
///
/// The practical consequence for triage: the first question on a report of this
/// behaviour is **which difficulty AND how many players**. Difficulty alone
/// under-determines it, and so does a Commander label. A **4-player report does
/// not rule this seam out** — `client/src/services/presets.ts` ships
/// `default-commander-ffa` ("Quick Commander (4-player FFA)": Commander, Medium,
/// `playerCount: 4`), which sits on the live side of the boundary and sees the
/// full offset.
///
/// That boundary is a routing fact, and the search-off regime keeps its own
/// coverage — name what supplies it. `search::prefer_land_drop` still runs there:
/// `deterministic_choice` calls it *ahead* of the `config.search.enabled` branch,
/// and `prefer_land_drop` accepts no `AiConfig` at all (`state`, `ai_player`,
/// `actions`), so no difficulty or player count can gate it. But it deliberately
/// fires only when **exactly one** `PlayLand` action exists, so that
/// `LandSequencingPolicy` can compare ambiguous land choices through scoring.
/// One land in hand is therefore
/// still played; **two or more** falls through to `PlannerServices::tactical_score`
/// (`should_play_now_with_facts` plus the policy registry), which is where
/// `policies::land_sequencing`, `policies::board_development`, and
/// `policies::landfall_timing` live. Those policies hold that regime; this offset
/// does not reach it.
///
/// - **REACHED — ward-cost sacrifice, and only that.**
///   `WaitingFor::WardSacrificeChoice` (CR 702.21a, "choose a permanent to
///   sacrifice as ward cost payment") emits one candidate per permanent in its
///   single-permanent form (`engine::ai_support::candidates`).
///   `deterministic_choice` has no arm for the variant, so those candidates
///   reach scoring, and each gives up exactly one permanent — so a pair of them
///   differs by one `BoardStats::mana_sources` whenever exactly one of the two
///   is a source, which is where this offset discriminates.
///   `WardSacrificeChoice`'s other two branches are excluded, and the exclusion
///   is structural rather than a matter of degree: the aggregate-power
///   (`min_total_power`) form maps a single deterministic
///   `power_threshold_witness` to exactly one selection — or to none when no
///   witness exists — and the empty-`permanents` form emits only a decline.
///   Neither expresses a choice, so no coefficient can move them.
/// - **NOT REACHED — the ordinary "sacrifice a permanent" choice**, which is the
///   one a reader of this section will picture. It arrives as
///   `WaitingFor::EffectZoneChoice` (`effects::sacrifice`), and
///   `deterministic_choice` **does** have an arm for it: when `effect_kind` is
///   `EffectKind::Sacrifice` with a non-empty `cards`, `!up_to`, and `count > 0`
///   it returns `pick_lowest_value_sacrifices` immediately, before any scoring.
///   That helper orders by `policies::strategy_helpers::sacrifice_key` —
///   documented there as "**the single battlefield give-up authority**", with
///   its own land axis and tiering. So the mandatory give-up decision is priced
///   by `sacrifice_key`, not by this offset, and changing this coefficient
///   cannot move it. Only the residue that the arm's guard excludes —
///   `up_to` (optional) sacrifices and `count == 0` — falls through to scoring.
/// - **NOT REACHED — `WaitingFor::ChooseObjectsSelection`.** Recorded explicitly
///   because an earlier revision of this very block cited it as the primary
///   reached class, and it is not one. Per its own variant doc in
///   `types::game_state`, it is the `ChooseObjectsIntoTrackedSet` selection: it
///   *references* battlefield permanents into a tracked set for a downstream
///   `PayCost { ScaledMana }` / `IfYouDo` / `Untap`.
///   **The permanents are not given up.** Its candidates do reach
///   scoring, but every one of them leaves the board population identical, so
///   `BoardStats::mana_sources` is equal across them and this offset cannot
///   discriminate. (`Untap` downstream does not change that: the count is a
///   development measure that ignores tapped state — see
///   `zone_eval::is_intrinsic_mana_source`.)
/// - **NOT REACHED — block assignment.** `score_candidates_core` intercepts
///   `WaitingFor::DeclareAttackers | DeclareBlockers` *after* `build_decision_context`
///   has already generated candidates, but *before* validation, gating, and
///   scoring, and routes to `deterministic_combat_choice` →
///   `combat_ai::choose_blockers_with_profile`, which ranks with
///   `evaluate_creature` / `threat_level` — the only two `eval` items
///   `combat_ai` imports. The block path cannot see this offset, so its
///   chump-block behaviour is **UNMEASURED** in exactly the sense Combo and Ramp
///   are above; do not read one into this disclosure.
///
/// Every reachability verdict above is established by code read, not by an
/// executed decision: no test drives a sacrifice or block prompt end to end.
///
/// Midrange, late, with the shipped tables, the eval-layer cost of losing one

///   + 0.778 (card_advantage) + 7.500 (this offset)` = **12.878**
/// - a **vanilla 4/4**: `2.598 + 3.209 + 4.800 + 0.778` = **11.385**
///
/// Break-even is a vanilla **4.7/4.7** body (a 4.0/4.0 body when the

///
/// Read that arithmetic for what the routing above supports and no further. It
/// is a property of the **evaluation function**: of two states differing by
/// which permanent left, the one that kept the dork scores higher. It becomes an
/// observable *decision* only where a scored candidate pair actually differs by
/// one source — per the routing, the ward-cost sacrifice and the optional
/// (`up_to`) residue — **plus, now that the term is a differential, any pair
/// that differs in an *opponent's* source count (removal of an opponent's mana
/// source, a countered ramp spell, an opponent's simulated land drop), and — in
/// the `opponents.len() >= 2` branch only — any pair that differs merely in an
/// opponent's *threat weight*, with no source changing hands at all. See the
/// threat-weight channel section below.** It is **not** a claim about blocks, and **not** a claim
/// about the ordinary sacrifice prompt; both are decided elsewhere, by
/// `combat_ai::choose_blockers_with_profile` and by `sacrifice_key` respectively.
/// An earlier revision of this block asserted the block case outright ("the AI
/// will chump-block a 4/4 to save a Llanowar Elves") — that was false, and the
/// consumer list at the top of this section was sufficient to refute it at the

/// the acquisition inversion, disclosed separately because it is a different
/// decision class with a different counterweight.
///
/// # The threat-weight channel — an ACCEPTED, SIGN-INVERTING cost (Unit 5)
///
/// New with the differential, and disclosed rather than fixed. In the

/// threat_level = board_score·0.4 + life_ratio·0.2 + hand_score·0.15 + cmd_threat·0.25
/// ```
///
/// **So any candidate that changes an opponent's threat level moves this term

/// *raises* the evaluator's mana score; lowering a *mana-poor* seat's threat
/// does the reverse, so the AI is *penalized* for removing a threat from the

///
/// Worked example — evaluator p0, two opponents, p1 with 8 sources and p2 with

///    This is the house pattern, not a new exposure.
/// 2. **The magnitudes differ.** `card_advantage`'s channel is scaled by the
///    fitted weight `w.card_advantage` (≈ 0.778 at midrange/late); this one is
///    scaled by `C = 7.5`, which carries **no weight of its own** because it is
///    applied after weighting — exactly 3× the largest fitted weight in the file.
/// 3. **The spread is wider.** The per-opponent mana-source spread in Commander
///    (2 vs 12) exceeds the non-creature-permanent spread, so the same weight
///    perturbation moves more.
///
/// **Branch guard: `opponents.len() >= 2`.** Two-player games are entirely
/// unaffected — the ≤ 1-opponent branch averages and has no weights to move.
/// That is also why `cargo ai-gate` cannot see this channel: `MatchupSpec` has
