//! Deciding whether to pay the aggregate combat tax imposed by UnlessPay combat

//! Norn's Annex) and their block-side twins.
//!
//! CR 508.1d + CR 509.1c: a player is never required to pay a combat tax, so the
//! engine's declaration-completion authority has to be told whether the
//! declaring seat intends to. [`plan_attack_tax`] and [`plan_block_tax`] make that
//! call BEFORE the declaration is submitted and return a
//! [`CombatTaxPosture`]: `Accept` keeps the taxed creatures, `Refuse` lets the
//! engine substitute its tax-free witness.
//!
//! The payment prompt that follows an `Accept` is answered by the engine-owned
//! `combat::pending_combat_tax_is_affordable`, not by a second judgement here.
//! Declining that prompt rebuilds the identical declare prompt, so an answer that
//! could disagree with the posture which opened it would loop. Keeping the
