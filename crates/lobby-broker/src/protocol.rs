//! Wire protocol for the lobby/matchmaking broker.
//!
//! This is the **lobby subset** of `server_core::protocol`, wire-compatible by
//! construction: every type uses the same `#[serde(tag = "type", content =
//! "data")]` shape and identical field names/`#[serde(default)]` attributes as
//! the canonical `ClientMessage`/`ServerMessage`, so the bytes on the wire are
//! byte-identical regardless of which enum (de)serializes a given frame.
//!
//! `LobbyGame` and `DraftLobbyMetadata` are **defined here** (the broker owns
//! the lobby-listing wire types) and re-exported by `server_core::protocol`, so
//! `server_core::ServerMessage::LobbyUpdate { games: Vec<LobbyGame> }` and the
//! broker both reference the same struct.
//!
//! Incoming frames are deserialized via a **two-stage parse** (`Envelope` →
//! tag match → variant): `#[serde(other)]` is invalid on adjacently-tagged
//! enums, so an unrecognized `type` is routed to the reject path explicitly
//! rather than collapsing into a magic catch-all variant (plan decision A2).

///      likewise cannot round-trip a frame a v70 peer would have to invent.
///      The break runs in BOTH directions and is unconditional **for a Winston

///      snapshot changes shape, and why the TypeScript mirrors of those fields
///      are declared optional. `play_first_chooser` is ADVISORY: it names the
///      seat the format gives the play/draw choice to, and no engine path
///      enforces it, because game one's starting player still comes from
///      CR 103.1's contest. `PackDistribution::SharedStackPiles { pile_count }`
///      forces nothing here: `DraftProcedure` is computed from `kind` and

///   variant has no producer and is deleted rather than deprecated. Removing
///   a variant is ordinarily a bump, and this one is not, for the reason the
///   next paragraph gives at length: 71 is unreleased upstream (upstream is
///   70), so no peer ever spoke a 71 that carried it, and a second number
///   would announce a break between two shapes that never coexisted on the
///   wire. No TypeScript mirror names it -- MEASURED,
///   `grep -rn SharedStackRequiresHumanSeats client/` is empty.
///
///   AMENDED IN PLACE, NOT BUMPED (2/3). `SharedStackState::history` and
///   `SharedStackView::history` — vectors of the new
///   `SharedStackDecisionRecord` (seat, pile, decision, pile_size; no card,
///   deliberately and permanently) — were added after this entry was
///   written. 71 is unreleased upstream (upstream is 70), so no peer has
///   ever spoken a 71 without them and there is no version for a bump to
///   separate: a second number would announce a break between two shapes
///   that never coexisted on the wire. Both carry `#[serde(default)]`, so a
///   local snapshot persisted by an earlier 71 build loads with an empty
///   history rather than failing `import_draft_session`; the TypeScript
///   mirror is REQUIRED rather than optional (`SharedStackView.history` in
///   `client/src/adapter/draft-adapter.ts`), because the view is built by
///   the engine on every frame and never by a client. They ride the same
///   Winston-pod condition as the rest of this entry: a non-Winston pod's
///   frames stay byte-identical to v70.
///
///   AMENDED IN PLACE, NOT BUMPED (3/3), on the same evidence — 71 is
///   unreleased upstream, so no peer has ever spoken a 71 without these:
///     * `SharedStackState::forced_draws` and `SharedStackView::forced_draw`
///       — the card a seat's final-pile decline drew off the top of the main
///       stack, sight unseen. The state field is per seat with
///       `#[serde(default)]`; the view field is the ONLY card-bearing
///       private field on that view and is projected to the drawing seat
///       alone, never to an opponent and never to either spectator
///       visibility. Rides the Winston-pod condition like the rest.
///     * `SeatPublicView::drafted_card_count` and
///       `DraftPlayerView::distribution` — and THESE TWO BREAK THE
///       CONDITION. They ride every kind's frames, so the sentence above
///       ("every other kind's draft frames are byte-identical to v70") is
///       true of everything named before this paragraph and false of these.
///       Both are required (non-`Option`) engine-built fields, so a v70
///       server's view fails to satisfy a v71 client's shape for EVERY kind,
///       not just Winston — which is what the version gate is for, and it
///       already refuses the mismatch. `drafted_card_count` is a count and
///       never an identity, and it is public in every kind: a pick-and-pass
///       seat's total follows from the pick number, and a shared stack's is
///       visible across the table. `distribution` is a procedure fact
///       published for the same reason `launch_capability` is, and
///       deliberately NOT status-gated, so a surface that outlives the
///       drafting phase can still tell a pile pod from a passing one.
/// 70 — `OutsideGameChoiceSource::BoosterPack` replaced its `set_code: String`
///      with a required `origin: PackOrigin` (`Set(code)` or `Cube`), so a
///      `WaitingFor::OutsideGameChoice` for an opened pack no longer decodes
///      on a v69 peer, and a v69 frame no longer decodes here. The handshake
///      must refuse the pairing. P2P moves in lockstep; lobby messages are
///      unchanged.
/// 69 — `GameEvent` gained the tagged variant `ExtraTurnCreated { player_id,
///      anchor }`. Event-bearing full-game frames can now carry that tag, so
///      the full-game handshake must reject v68 peers that do not share the
///      variant contract. P2P moves in lockstep; lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 68 — `PendingManaAbility::chosen_tappers` changed from `Vec<ObjectId>` to
///      `Option<Vec<ObjectId>>` (#8698) — a `GameState` payload field type
///      change, so an ANSWERED zero-tapper selection of the CR 107.3a
///      X-sentinel form (X=0) is distinguishable from a selection stage that
///      has not been answered at all, and `chosen_tappers` intentionally
///      carries no `#[serde(default)]` (a missing `chosen_tappers` must fail
///      deserialization, not silently read as unanswered and re-surface the
///      same `WaitingFor::PayCost` forever — the exact livelock the retype
///      fixes), so old and new peers can't parse each other's serialized
///      snapshots.
/// 67 — `DerivedViews::DungeonRoomView` gained required `card`
///      (`DungeonCardView`) and `rooms` (`Vec<DungeonRoomNodeView>`) fields,
///      publishing the dungeon card's Scryfall identity and the full room
///      graph with each room's outgoing edges and its position on the card
///      face. A PARSE bump like 66, not a silent capability loss like 24:
///      neither field carries a serde default, so a v66 peer cannot
///      deserialize a snapshot in which anyone is venturing. The break is
///      symmetric — a v67 client reading a v66 host's `dungeon_rooms` entry
///      finds no `card` and throws in render rather than degrading. Follows
///      the same reasoning as the earlier dungeon-projection bump, which
///      chose a parse break over letting a mismatched peer play on with a
///      dead panel.
/// 66 — `ReplacementCondition::FirstTokenCreationEachTurn` moved its required
///      `player` field to an optional `active_player_req`, and
///      `CopyTargetPurpose` gained a `CopyTokenSource` variant. Both are
///      one-way parse breaks. `player` was a REQUIRED field through v65 and
///      carried no `#[serde(default)]`, so a v65 peer hits a missing-field
///      error on a v66 payload; `CopyTargetPurpose` is `#[serde(tag = "type")]`,
///      so a v65 peer hits an unknown-variant error on `CopyTokenSource`.
///      Authored against 65 and renumbered here: #8497 claimed 65 for
///      the entry below while this branch was open, and
///      `check-protocol-version.mjs` could not catch the collision
///      because it enforces that the Rust and TS constants AGREE, not
///      that the number is UNCLAIMED.
///      Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 65 — `DraftMatchStart` now announces the exact Full-session identity for
///      the spawned match. Draft reconnect uses the authenticated draft seat
///      to attach that socket to the same Full-session lifetime, and Full
///      follow-up frames carry the identity needed to reject stale-generation
///      traffic. `DraftMatchStart.full_key` is a non-optional new field, so
///      this is a parse bump, not a capability bump. Authored against 64 and
///      renumbered here: #8592 claimed 64 for the entry below while this
///      branch was open, and `check-protocol-version.mjs` could not catch the
///      collision because it enforces that the Rust and TS constants AGREE,
///      not that the number is UNCLAIMED. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 64 — Retroactive bump for two new-tag changes that landed under 62/63
///      WITHOUT their own bump. Both are one-way parse breaks by the rule
///      entries 46, 51 and 62 state ("no serde default can rescue an unknown
///      variant"), so the exact-match full-game handshake must refuse the
///      pairing rather than admit it and fail mid-game:
///      (a) #8501 added `Effect::OpenBoosterPack`, plus the `BoosterPack`
///          variants of `OutsideGameChoiceSource` and `OutsideGameSelection`.
///          Both enums are `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]`, so the
///          new arms emit TAG VALUES no older peer has a case for, and they
///          ride `GameState.waiting_for` and `GameAction`.
///      (b) #8332 added `slots` + `slot_pools` to `WaitingFor::RetargetChoice`
///          and `controller` to `StackEntryDisplay`. These carry
///          `#[serde(default)]`, so an old peer decodes and then MISRENDERS —
///          `RetargetChoiceModal.tsx` indexes `slot_pools`, whose `??` guards
///          an undefined element rather than an undefined array, so an old
///          host paired with a new guest throws during render.
///      No wire shape changes in THIS bump; it exists so the handshake stops
///      admitting the skew those two PRs opened. `check-protocol-version.mjs`
///      could not have caught either one: it enforces that the Rust and TS
///      constants AGREE, not that they were INCREMENTED, and both PRs kept
///      them agreeing at the wrong value. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 63 — `WaitingFor::ReplacementChoice` gained an engine-owned
///      `ReplacementChoiceKind` discriminator and a `last_applied_decides`
///      flag. Both are `#[serde(default)]`, so a v62 peer decodes the payload
///      successfully and then falls back to the `Order` default: it renders a
///      drag-to-order list for a yes/no "you may" prompt, and names a winning
///      outcome for a compositional collision that has none. A silent
///      misrender rather than a decode failure, so the exact-match full-game
///      handshake must refuse the pairing. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 62 — `ServerMessage::{GameStarted, StateUpdate}` gained
///      `activation_block_reasons: HashMap<ObjectId, Vec<AbilityBlockEntry>>` —
///      the CR 118.3 "you can't pay this cost right now" read-out, scoped to the
///      acting player and empty for everyone else. It carries
///      `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "HashMap::is_empty")]`, so a v61
///      payload reads as the absent/empty map it always meant. The break is the
///      other direction, and it is over-determined: `AbilityBlockKind` is
///      `#[serde(tag = "type")]`, so the new `CostNotPayableNow` arm emits a TAG
///      VALUE no v61 peer has a case for — a v61 Rust peer fails to deserialize
///      the entry, and a v61 client indexes its reason-key record with an
///      unknown member and renders `t(undefined)`. New tag, not merely a new
///      field, so the bump does not rest on the serde attributes above.
///
/// 61 — `Effect::ChooseCounterKind` gained `domain: CounterKindDomain` and
///      `chooser: CounterKindChooser` — the population a counter-kind choice
///      draws its legal kinds from, and whether the GAME draws one at random
///      instead of prompting the controller (CR 608.2d). Both carry
///      `#[serde(default)]`, so a v60 payload reads as the on-target/controller
///      form it always meant. The break is the other direction: a v60 peer has
///      no field to receive `Printed`/`Random` into and sets no
///      `deny_unknown_fields` to reject them, so it reads Crystalline Giant's
///      printed-list random draw as an on-target choice, finds no counters on a
///      fresh Giant, and places nothing — the exact defect this bump ships the
///      fix for (#7796). Abilities and trigger definitions ride inside
///      `GameObject`, so every full-GameState frame carries the shape. Full-game
///      floors are exact-match on both sides, so the pairing is refused at the
///      handshake. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 60 — `DerivedViews::back_face_spell_costs` publishes, for each card the
///      viewer may cast whose player chooses a spell face at cast time (a split
///      card such as a Room, a spell//spell MDFC — CR 709.3 + CR 712.11b), the
///      live cost of the OTHER face; `spell_costs` reports the live face only.
///      The cost badge renders both faces from this map. Serde-additive, but
///      the client renders the map directly; a v59 host would silently show a
///      Room's single-face badge again, on top of the second half's printed
///      cost. Full-game handshakes must refuse that capability mismatch. Lobby
///      messages are unchanged.
/// 59 — `InteractionResponseSpec::Shortcut::preview` changed from
///      `Option<InteractionShortcutPreview>` to `Vec<InteractionShortcutPreview>`,
///      one element per offerable count, and each element gained
///      `allocation: Vec<AmountAssignment>`, the declaration's shape over that
///      element's count. The retype is the break; `allocation` is not — it carries
///      `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty")]`, neither type
///      sets `deny_unknown_fields`, and it parses in both directions. A PARSE bump
///      like 23, 36 and 42, not a capability bump like 24 — and an ASYMMETRIC one,
///      so both directions are stated. v58 → v59 fails on EVERY shortcut offer: the
///      old field carried no `skip_serializing_if`, so a v58 peer always emits the
///      key, and neither `null` nor an object deserializes into a sequence.
///      v59 → v58 fails only on an offer that actually carries a preview, because
///      an empty list omits the key and a v58 peer's `Option` field reads that as
///      `None`. The retype breaks the declared Rust types, but no production Rust
///      code deserializes `ServerMessage` — the browser half is what decodes those
///      frames, with `JSON.parse` and no validation, which is why the handshake is
///      the only place the pairing is refusable. No shim ships

/// 57 — `GameAction::BeginResolveAll` gained `scope: ResolveAllScope` (`Own`
///      binds only the requester and resolves immediately; `Shared` opens the
///      table-wide consent protocol), and `PriorityPassingMode` gained
///      `FullControl`, which is now engine-authoritative rather than a

///      battlefield Room in printed order, resolved through the COPIED halves
///      for a permanent that copies a Room (CR 709.5b + CR 707.2). The unlock

///      (CR 709.5e) from this map; an enter-as-copy recipient carries neither
///      on its own printed card, and printed order is engine work. The field
///      is serde-additive, but the client renders the map directly rather than
///      deriving halves from raw state; a v54 host would silently label every
///      offered door "Tap for Mana" again. Full-game handshakes must refuse
///      that capability mismatch. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 54 — `CreateDraftWithSettings` now carries a tagged `DraftSourceIntent`.
///      A Chaos client sends only candidate set codes; the Full server resolves
///      and persists the private seat-by-round assignment matrix. This changes
///      a Full-server client message, so the full handshake refuses stale
///      peers. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 53 — `DraftPlayerView::launch_capability` publishes the engine-authorized
///      post-draft multiplayer launch. The client renders this procedure-owned
///      capability instead of inferring it from `DraftKind`; an older server
///      would omit it and silently hide a completed Commander pod's launch.
///      Full-game handshakes must refuse that capability mismatch. Lobby
///      messages are unchanged.
/// 52 — `DerivedViews::storm_count` publishes the engine-owned number of
///      copies a current Storm trigger will create, or a newly cast Storm spell
///      would create. The field is serde-additive, but the client renders this
///      scalar directly rather than deriving Storm from raw state; a v51 host
///      would therefore silently omit the HUD status. Full-game handshakes
///      must refuse that capability mismatch. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// Note: renaming or removing a variant silently fails at JSON parse time
/// (clients see "Invalid message: unknown variant") rather than at the

///
/// 51 — Casting permissions gained a typed lifetime. Two parts:
///      (a) `CastingPermission::ExileWithAltAbilityCost` gained `duration` and
///      `source_id`; `::ExileWithAltCost` gained `source_id` beside the
///      `duration` it already carried. `source_id` is the granting permanent
///      that bounds a host-lifetime duration — additive behind serde defaults.
///      (b) `Duration` gained the `WhileControllingHost` ("for as long as you
///      control ~") and `WhileHostOnBattlefield` ("for as long as ~ remains on
///      the battlefield") variants (CR 611.2b). Each new tag is a ONE-WAY
///      parse break like entry 46: a v50 peer cannot deserialize a `GameState`
///      containing it, and no serde default can rescue an unknown variant, so
///      the full-game handshake must refuse the pairing. Lobby messages are
///      unchanged.
/// 50 — `FormatConfig` gained `default_deck_copy_limit`, the resolved
///      per-format deck-copy ceiling (CR 100.2a / CR 100.2b / CR 903.5b)
///      `max_deck_copies` and the deck-compatibility admission path now both
///      read, replacing per-function hardcoded literals and bare-`GameFormat`
///      -derived defaults so the two authorities can't disagree. A CAPABILITY
///      bump like 24: the field is `#[serde(default =
///      "default_deck_copy_limit_fallback")]` (`UpTo(1)`, the tightest
///      possible cap), so a peer missing it still deserializes `GameState`
///      cleanly — but silently loses the format's real declared limit and
///      falls back to the fail-closed singleton cap, wrongly rejecting a
///      legal 4-of deck under Standard/Pioneer/etc. rather than admitting one
///      it shouldn't. The direction is symmetric: whichever peer lacks the
///      field degrades the same way, fail-closed, never fail-open. Lobby
///      carriers move too; see `LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 3.
/// 49 — Full-server `DraftPlayerView` payloads require public-seat
///      `active_pack_count`. An older v48 server can complete the handshake
///      yet omit that serde-additive field while the TypeScript client accepts
///      the JSON, leaving it unable to render a seat's active-pack presence.
///      Full handshakes must refuse the capability mismatch. Lobby messages
///      are unchanged.
/// 48 — Full-server `DraftPlayerView` payloads require the engine-owned
///      `pick_selection_mode`. An older server can omit it while the
///      TypeScript client accepts the JSON, then silently treats an ordered
///      Commander Draft pick as direct selection. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 47 — Resolution-time optional fixed sacrifice payments add a typed
///      replacement-resumable continuation to `GameState`.
/// 46 — `QuantityRef::Aggregate` and `QuantityRef::TrackedSetAggregate` were
///      replaced on the serialized `GameState` surface by the canonical
///      `QuantityRef::PropertyAggregate` tag with a validated `source` object.
///      New peers accept the two legacy input tags, but a v45 peer cannot
///      deserialize the canonical tag emitted by v46, so full-game handshakes
///      must refuse the one-way parse mismatch. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 45 — `GameState` gained serialized cast-occurrence provenance and prepared-copy links.
/// 44 — Resolution-time optional `PayCost(OneOf)` branch choice added a
///      serialized `WaitingFor`/`GameAction` pair.
/// 43 — Engine-owned stack-resolution automation retired the legacy native
///      Resolve All request/result wire messages.
/// 42 — `FormatConfig.deck_size` changed from a bare `u16` to the adjacently
///      tagged `DeckSizeRule` enum (`Minimum(u16)` / `Exactly(u16)`), because
///      CR 903.13f(1) makes Commander Draft a command-zone format with a
///      minimum rather than an exact size, and `GameFormat` gained a
///      `CommanderDraft` variant (CR 903.13a). A PARSE bump like 23 and 36,
///      not a capability bump like 24: `FormatConfig::deck_size` carries
///      neither `#[serde(default)]` nor `deserialize_with`, so a v41 peer's
///      `"deck_size": 60` fails against the adjacently tagged enum and a v42
///      peer's `{"type":"Minimum","data":60}` fails against a v41 `u16` — the
///      break is unconditional and runs in BOTH directions, for every format.
///      `GameState::format_config`'s `#[serde(default = "FormatConfig::standard")]`
///      does NOT rescue it: a field-level default applies only when the key is
///      ABSENT, and an old peer sends the key present with the old inner shape,
///      so the default never runs. The `GameFormat::CommanderDraft` variant is
///      the second and narrower half — it breaks only when that variant is
///      actually serialized.
/// 41 — Operational failure responses are correlated to their pending action.
/// 40 — Action rejection responses carry engine-owned structured context.
/// 39 — `ManaRestriction::CannotCastSpellFromZone` adds a serialized
///      GameState/ManaUnit restriction used by Karolina Dean. Older peers
///      cannot deserialize that externally tagged enum variant. Lobby messages
///      are unchanged.
/// 38 — `WaitingFor::ChooseObjectsSelection` publishes the resolving effect's
///      `min` and optional `max` bounds. Older clients parse and silently
///      ignore these additive fields, then offer selections outside the
///      engine-authoritative range; refuse that capability mismatch at the
///      full-game handshake. Lobby messages are unchanged.
/// 37 — `PayCostKind::TapCreatures` changed from `{ aggregate:
///      Option<TapCreaturesAggregate> }` to a required `{ mode:
///      TapCreaturesSelectionMode }` (Fixed/VariableX/Aggregate) — the fix
///      that also unlocks the `u32::MAX` X-sentinel tap-cost form (Glacian,
///      Powerstone Engineer + 8 sibling cards, #7799). `mode` carries no
///      `#[serde(default)]`: a `GameState` snapshot paused mid-TapCreatures
///      payment (Crew/Saddle/Teamwork/Conspire, or the newly-unlocked
///      X-sentinel form) under the old `aggregate` shape now fails
///      deserialization rather than risk silently misclassifying an
///      aggregate payment as fixed-count (or vice versa) — exactly the
///      ambiguity `TapCreaturesSelectionMode` exists to make
///      unrepresentable. Old and new peers can't parse each other's
///      serialized snapshots while such a payment is in flight.
/// 36 — `WaitingFor::ChooseDungeon::options` changed from `Vec<DungeonId>` to
///      `Vec<DungeonPreview>`, and `WaitingFor::ChooseDungeonRoom` dropped
///      `option_names`, gained a required `dungeon_name`, and changed `options`
///      from `Vec<u8>` to `Vec<RoomPreview>`, so each option carries the room's
///      printed name and room-ability text (CR 309.4b-c). A PARSE bump like 23,
///      not a capability bump like 24: none of the new fields carry
///      `#[serde(default)]`, so a v35 peer fails deserialization on a
///      dungeon-choice `GameState` outright rather than degrading silently.
///      `DerivedViews::dungeon_rooms` rides along in the same bump — it IS
///      `#[serde(default)]`, but the client deleted its `dungeon_progress`
///      room-index derivation, so a v35 server that omits it would leave a new
///      client rendering no dungeon badge at all.
/// 35 — `DerivedViews::current_target_kind` publishes the engine's CR 115.1
///      classification of the live target announcement. A CAPABILITY bump like
///      24 and 32, not a parse bump: the field is `Option` +
///      `skip_serializing_if`, but the client deleted `inferTargetNoun`, so a
///      v34 server that omits it would leave a new client naming no target at
///      all — silently, with no parse error to catch it.
/// 34 — `DraftKind::CommanderDraft` (CR 903.13a) is serialized by draft
///      WebSocket messages, and `DraftAction::Pick` renamed
///      `card_instance_id: String` to `card_instance_ids: Vec<String>` to carry
///      a whole CR 903.13b pick step. The rename is a PARSE bump, not a
///      capability bump: `card_instance_ids` carries no `#[serde(default)]`, so
///      a v33 `Pick` frame fails deserialization on a v34 peer and vice versa.
///      `DraftAction::SubmitDeck::commanders` is additive and `#[serde(default)]`
///      — exempt on its own; it is listed because 34 carries it, not because it
///      forces 34.
///      For a client that advertises `lobby_protocol_version`, this number
///      does not gate lobby admission: both ends compare the LOBBY number
///      instead, and the client echoes the broker's own `protocol_version`
///      back (`openPhaseSocket.ts`) so the legacy window compares a value to
///      itself. On the LEGACY path it DOES gate, at both ends — the
///      `MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL ..= PROTOCOL_VERSION` window here, and a
///      client-side ceiling in `ws-adapter.ts` that runs BEFORE that echo —
///      so a client built in the window between the previous bump and the
///      lobby-owned version is evicted by this move. No RELEASED tag sits on
///      the legacy path with a `protocol_version` inside the post-bump
///      window; every released build still on that path is already below its
///      own ceiling and stays refused. Lobby gating lives in
///      `LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` / `MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`, which
///      move to 2 alongside this bump for the `FormatConfig.deck_size`
///      retype — that pair is what evicts a released cohort; see its own
///      changelog entry for who and for what is lost.
/// 33 — `LegendCandidateIdentity::Unknown` prevents face-down legend candidates
///      from publishing an affirmative original/copy identity.
/// 32 — `DerivedViews::legend_candidate_identities` publishes the engine-authored
///      original/copy/token-copy identity for each active legend-rule choice. The
///      field is `#[serde(default)]`, but the client deliberately no longer derives
///      this rules-sensitive identity from raw objects; an older server would
///      silently omit every choice identity.
/// 31 — `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` publishes the engine-issued `declaration`, and
///      `InteractionResponseSpec::Shortcut` publishes `preview`, the per-axis
///      consequence of the offered count. Both are `Option` and neither type sets
///      `deny_unknown_fields`, so a v30 peer still *parses* the frame — this is a
///      capability bump like 24, not a parse bump. UNLIKE 24, no pairing is left to
///      exercise the gap, so this entry names no silent-drop hazard. Full-game floors
///      are exact-match on both sides (`server_core::MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL ==
///      PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and `MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_PROTOCOL` in
///      `client/src/adapter/ws-adapter.ts`), so a v31/v30 full-game pair is refused
///      at the handshake and never sends an action frame. The one-version window is
///      this file's `MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL` below, and it is lobby-only:
///      `DeclareShortcut` rides `ClientMessage::Action`, which `LobbyClientMessage`
///      has no variant for at all, and which `reject_if_disabled` in
///      `crates/phase-server/src/main.rs` answers under `ServerMode::LobbyOnly` with
///      an explicit rejection rather than a silent drop. The P2P games this broker
///      matchmakes are gated tighter still, on build-commit equality
///      (`check_build_commit`), not on a protocol window.
/// 30 — Serialized player-action completion provenance and modal continuations.
/// 29 — Added requester-correlated `ResolveAllRejected` response frames.
/// 28 — Added native `ResolveAll` request/result frames.
/// 27 — Added `DraftKind::Sealed`, serialized by draft WebSocket messages.
/// 26 — Added `ServerMessage::ActionNoOp` for accepted transport no-ops.
/// 25 — `DebugCardEntries` added a serialized, private resolution frame for
///      multi-card sandbox battlefield entries that pause for replacement or
///      as-enters choices. Old peers cannot deserialize that `GameState` shape.
/// 24 — `DerivedViews::unbounded_families` carries the engine-owned per-seat
///      family collapse state behind each `∞` badge. The field is
///      `#[serde(default)]`, so this is a capability bump rather than a parse
///      bump: the client deleted its row-flag OR-fold derivation, so a v23
///      server that omits the field would leave a new client rendering NO
///      infinity badges at all, silently and with no parse error to catch it.
/// 23 — `PayableResource::ManaGeneric` changed from `{ per_x }` to
///      `{ base_cost: ManaCost }` (#6410) — a `GameState` payload field type
///      change, and `base_cost` intentionally carries no `#[serde(default)]`
///      (a missing `base_cost` must fail deserialization, not silently
///      resolve to a zero-cost payment), so old and new peers can't parse
///      each other's serialized snapshots.
/// 20 — Actor-scoped priority-passing settings and filtered per-player state.
/// 19 — Connive's exact `EventObjectSnapshot` subject and resident paused
///      post-replacement drains changed serialized full-game state. Phase 4
///      later pinned the existing v2 resolution wire shape; it did not add a
///      second protocol change.
/// 18 — Serialized GameState trigger provenance and paused logical zone-change
///      owners are now wire-visible.
/// 16 — Meld pair/attacking-entry choices after mana-payment preview variants.
/// 15 — Mana-payment preview request/response variants.
/// 14 — `PrecastCopyShortcut` action and its two `WaitingFor` variants.
/// 13 — `WaitingFor::MulliganBottomCards` removed from the full-game state
///      payload; mulligan bottoming folded into a
///      `MulliganDecisionPhase::BottomCards` sub-phase on
///      `WaitingFor::MulliganDecision`.

///      deserializes through `FromStr`
///      (`crates/engine/src/types/format.rs`), whose unknown-name arm
///      returns `Err`, so a build that predates the new format

///      short-circuits on the `Custom:` prefix and parses the id, failing
///      only when it is not a `u16`, so a `Custom:<id>` payload still
///      deserializes. Pinned by

///      (whose inputs include `"NotARealFormat"`) and

///      does not hard-error at all: it decodes with `JSON.parse` and its
///      TypeScript types are erased at runtime, so an unknown format name
///      arrives there as an ordinary string. The break is one-directional.
///      On THIS surface the broker -> client direction still decodes a

///      `FreeformCommander` to a Rust broker below 11 fails:
///      `GameFormat::deserialize` rejects the frame. The client-side floor
///      for that pairing is `MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_FREEFORM_FORMATS` in

///      browsing and joining over a value most of them will never
///      encounter. [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] does not move alongside it either: no
///      variant here carries `GameState` or `GameAction`. (Written as one
///      unbroken paragraph on purpose, per the reason entry 5 gives:
///      a blank `///` line before 4-space indented prose is an indented
///      CODE block to rustdoc.)
/// 10 — Requested room codes. `CreateGameWithSettings` gains an optional
///     `requested_code` (`#[serde(default)]`) — the "a lobby field is added"
///     trigger — carrying a caller-pre-minted `[A-Z0-9]{6}` code (the Discord
///     LFG bot mints it before the host creates the room) that the host claims
///     instead of a broker-minted one; `None` keeps broker minting.
///     [`ServerErrorCode`], carried server → client on `Error.code`, gains
///     `game_not_found` (a lookup or join code that resolves to no listing) and
///     `code_in_use` (a requested code already held). Purely ADDITIVE, so
///     [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`] does **not** move: a pre-10 broker drops
///     the unknown field and mints its own code, a silent capability loss the
///     client detects as `GameCreated.game_code != requested`; a pre-10 client
///     reads the new codes as an ignored optional string, and every coded
///     message keeps its prose, so substring classification still works — the
///     only out-of-build consumer of these frames is the browser's
///     `JSON.parse`. Any client-side floor gating on requested codes belongs to
///     the client change that first relies on them. [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] does
///     not move: the `ClientMessage` twin is an optional `#[serde(default)]`

///     (`#[serde(default)]`, optional) — the "a lobby field is added" trigger.
///     `renew_credential` used to mint a new secret, commit it, and invalidate
///     the old one atomically, so a renewal reply lost after the commit stranded
///     the holder on a dead, unrenewable secret (the #8782 \[HIGH\]). Now a
///     rotation from the current secret records the secret it superseded beside
///     that nonce, and a retry presenting the superseded secret WITH the same
///     nonce REPLAYS the already-committed secret instead of minting a second one
///     — so a lost reply is recoverable, while a superseded secret alone (a
///     wrong or absent nonce) can neither mint nor obtain a credential, keeping
///     the authority with its legitimate holder rather than allowing a takeover.
///     Purely ADDITIVE, so [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`] does **not** move:
///     the field is optional (a frame omitting it deserializes to an empty
///     nonce, which can only mint from a current secret, never replay), only v9+
///     clients send this frame at all, and a pre-9 broker ignores the unknown
///     field. A v9-aware client additionally gates its PROACTIVE rotation on the

///     `CreateTournament` gains `format: Option<GameFormat>` — a display label
///     for the event's format, mirroring the `format: Option<GameFormat>`
///     [`LobbyGame`] already carries — and (b) `plus_rounds: Option<u32>`,
///     which adds N to the bracket- and arity-derived default round count for
///     the "Swiss plus N" community shape (mutually exclusive with the existing
///     `total_rounds` override, rejected at validation). (c) [`TournamentSummary`]
///     gains `format: Option<GameFormat>`, server → client, so a browsing or
///     spectating client sees the resolved label without recomputing it. This
///     entry is one unbroken paragraph on purpose, for the reason entry 5 below
///     spells out — a blank `///` line before 4-space-indented prose is a

///     [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`] does **not** move and — unlike 6(c) — no
///     client-side capability floor is needed. A new client's `format`/`plus_rounds`
///     reaching a pre-7 broker deserialize away as unknown fields (no enum here
///     sets `deny_unknown_fields`), so the event is created with no label and
///     the auto round count, a silent capability loss rather than a parse error.
///     A pre-7 broker's summary omitting `format` is inert against a new client
///     whose consumer is `JSON.parse`. [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] does **not** move:
///     no variant here carries `GameState` or `GameAction`.
/// 6 — Broker-owned tournament action legality, broker-owned default scoring,
///     and expiring/rotating tournament credentials. Three triggers fire at
///     once and any one of them alone would be mandatory. (a) Two
///     [`LobbyClientMessage`]/[`LobbyServerMessage`] variants are added —
///     `RenewTournamentCredential` and `TournamentCredentialRenewed` — the
///     "a lobby variant is added" trigger. (b) [`PairingView`] gains a required
///     `report_gate` and [`TournamentSummary`] gains a required `open_actions`
///     and a required `scoring`, all three server → client, so the broker
///     rather than every client owns which affordances are legal and what an
///     event actually scores. (c) `CreateTournament::scoring` is RELAXED from a
///     required [`crate::tournament::ScoringPolicy`] to an optional one, with
///     `None` meaning "the broker applies `ScoringPolicy::default_for_arity`" —
///     the "a field type changed" trigger. `TournamentCreated` and
///     `TournamentJoined` additionally gain a required `expires_at_ms` beside
///     the token each already carried, because a credential that expires is
///     useless to a holder who cannot learn when. [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`]
///     does **not** move, and the asymmetry between (b) and (c) is the reason
///     it does not have to. The server → client additions are inert against an
///     older client: the consumer is `JSON.parse`, which ignores unknown
///     fields, so nothing it already understood breaks. The client → broker
///     relaxation is NOT symmetric — a new client omitting `scoring` against a
///     pre-6 broker gets a hard `missing field` parse error, not a degrade —
///     but that direction is gated by a CLIENT-side capability floor
///     (`MIN_LOBBY_PROTOCOL_FOR_DEFAULT_SCORING` in
///     `client/src/adapter/ws-adapter.ts`), which keeps a below-floor client
///     sending an explicit policy, rather than by evicting the session here. A
///     broker floor move would evict every older client over a field they can
///     simply keep sending. [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] does **not** move either: no
///     variant here carries `GameState` or `GameAction`.
/// 5 — Request-correlated settlement for the four GATED tournament actions.
///     Two [`LobbyServerMessage`] variants are added — `TournamentActionAck`
///     and `TournamentActionRejected` — which is the first of the four triggers
///     listed above and is what makes this bump mandatory. Both are
///     requester-only point replies carrying the [`TournamentRequestId`] the
///     caller minted, so a caller can tell its own outcome from an ambient
///     `TournamentUpdate` for the same tournament. `TournamentUpdate` itself is
///     deliberately unchanged: it is fanned out to every subscriber, and a
///     correlator on a broadcast would either be meaningless to all of them or
///     force a second, differently-shaped frame for the acting client.
///     `StartTournamentRound`, `ReportMatchResult`, `DropFromTournament` and
///     `EndTournament` each gain one optional `request_id`, with the same
///     `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` shape
///     `ClientHello::lobby_protocol_version` already uses in this enum. Purely
///     ADDITIVE in BOTH directions, which is why [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`]
///     does **not** move: an old frame omitting the field deserializes to
///     `None` on a v5 broker, and a v5 frame carrying it deserializes cleanly on
///     a v4 broker because neither enum sets `deny_unknown_fields`. A `None`
///     correlator serializes to byte-identical output to today's, so an
///     uncorrelated caller sees no change on the wire at all. Finally,
///     [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] does **not** move: no variant here carries
///     `GameState` or `GameAction`, so the lobby number is the one that
///     governs — the same rule the tournament set itself followed at 4, which
///     added twelve variants across three crates and moved only this constant.
///     (Written as one unbroken paragraph on purpose. A blank `///` line
///     followed by this 4-space indentation is an indented CODE block to
///     rustdoc, which then tries to compile the prose as a doctest.)
/// 4 — The tournament-organizer message set: seven [`LobbyClientMessage`]
///     variants (`CreateTournament`, `JoinTournament`, `GetTournament`,
///     `StartTournamentRound`, `ReportMatchResult`, `DropFromTournament`,
///     `EndTournament`) and five [`LobbyServerMessage`] variants
///     (`TournamentCreated`, `TournamentJoined`, `TournamentUpdate`,
///     `TournamentRemoved`, `TournamentListUpdate`). "A lobby variant is
///     added" is the first of the four triggers listed above, so this bump is
///     required by this constant's own documented policy.
///     Purely ADDITIVE, which is why [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`] does
///     **not** move alongside it — the asymmetry with 2 is deliberate. Bump 2
///     retyped a field three existing carriers already held in both
///     directions, so a v1 peer could neither send nor interpret a frame it
///     routinely exchanged; only a floor move could say that out loud. Nothing
///     here changes any existing variant's shape. A v2 client keeps parsing
///     every frame it already understood, never sends a tournament variant,
///     and — for the broker → client half where `JSON.parse` validates nothing
///     — receives no tournament frame at all unless it first subscribed to a
///     surface it has no code for. Raising the floor would evict that entire
///     cohort's lobby session to protect it from messages it cannot receive.
///     On the client → broker half a v4-only tag reaching a v2 broker is
///     already answered per-frame by [`ParsedFrame::UnknownTag`], which is the
///     stated reason no upper bound exists either.
/// 3 — `FormatConfig` gained `default_deck_copy_limit` (see `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
///     50 for the full entry). Same three carriers as 2:
///     `CreateGameWithSettings` on [`LobbyClientMessage`] (client → broker),
///     `JoinTargetInfo` and `PeerInfo` on [`LobbyServerMessage`] (broker →
///     client). Unlike 2, this is a CAPABILITY bump, not a parse bump — the
///     field is `#[serde(default)]` and still deserializes cleanly on either
///     side — so [`MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`] does NOT move: a v2 client
///     can still create/join a game, it just can't declare or observe a
///     non-default deck-copy-limit override, silently getting the fail-closed
///     `UpTo(1)` fallback instead of the format's real default. That is a
///     capability loss, not a broken session — the same shape as
///     `PROTOCOL_VERSION`'s own capability-bump entries (24, 50), not this
///     file's own entry 2.
/// 2 — `FormatConfig::deck_size` changed from a bare `u16` to the adjacently
///     tagged `DeckSizeRule` — a field TYPE change, one of the four triggers
///     listed above.
///     Three lobby carriers hold a `FormatConfig`, in both directions:
///     `CreateGameWithSettings` on [`LobbyClientMessage`] (client → broker),
///     and `JoinTargetInfo` and `PeerInfo` on [`LobbyServerMessage`]
///     (broker → client). The client → broker one fails LOUDLY: serde refuses
///     a bare integer for an adjacently tagged enum, so the frame is reported
///     as [`ParsedFrame::Malformed`]. The two broker → client carriers cannot
///     fail at all — the browser deserializes them with `JSON.parse`, which
///     validates nothing, and the TypeScript declaration is erased at
///     runtime. That asymmetry is WHY a version number is the only available
///     signal here: on the broker → client half no per-frame check exists to
///     reject a stale shape.
///     What the paired floor move evicts: the entire lobby session of every
///     client built against lobby version 1 — hosting, browsing and joining
///     alike — even though exactly one `LobbyClientMessage` variant actually
///     carries a `FormatConfig` and the rest would still have parsed. It
///     migrates nothing and does not make such a client work; it converts a
///     mid-session create-game failure — and, on the join path, a `deck_size`
///     in a shape that build cannot interpret and that no per-frame check on
