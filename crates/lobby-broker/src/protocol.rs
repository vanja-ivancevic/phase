//! Wire protocol for the lobby/matchmaking broker.
//!
//! This is the **lobby subset** of `server_core::protocol`, wire-compatible by
//! construction: every type uses the same `#[serde(tag = "type", content =
//! "data")]` shape and identical field names/`#[serde(default)]` attributes as
//! the canonical `ClientMessage`/`ServerMessage`, so the bytes on the wire are
//! byte-identical regardless of which enum (de)serializes a given frame.
//!
//! `LobbyGame` and `DraftLobbyMetadata` are **defined here** (the broker owns
//! the lobby-listing wire types) and re-exported by `server_core::protocol`, so
//! `server_core::ServerMessage::LobbyUpdate { games: Vec<LobbyGame> }` and the
//! broker both reference the same struct.
//!
//! Incoming frames are deserialized via a **two-stage parse** (`Envelope` →
//! tag match → variant): `#[serde(other)]` is invalid on adjacently-tagged
//! enums, so an unrecognized `type` is routed to the reject path explicitly
//! rather than collapsing into a magic catch-all variant (plan decision A2).

///      that also unlocks the `u32::MAX` X-sentinel tap-cost form (Glacian,

///      `option_names`, gained a required `dungeon_name`, and changed `options`

///      classification of the live target announcement. A CAPABILITY bump like
///      24 and 32, not a parse bump: the field is `Option` +
///      `skip_serializing_if`, but the client deleted `inferTargetNoun`, so a
///      v34 server that omits it would leave a new client naming no target at
///      all — silently, with no parse error to catch it.
/// 34 — `DraftKind::CommanderDraft` (CR 903.13a) is serialized by draft
///      WebSocket messages, and `DraftAction::Pick` renamed
///      `card_instance_id: String` to `card_instance_ids: Vec<String>` to carry
///      a whole CR 903.13b pick step. The rename is a PARSE bump, not a
///      capability bump: `card_instance_ids` carries no `#[serde(default)]`, so
///      a v33 `Pick` frame fails deserialization on a v34 peer and vice versa.
///      `DraftAction::SubmitDeck::commanders` is additive and `#[serde(default)]`
///      — exempt on its own; it is listed because 34 carries it, not because it
///      forces 34.
///      For a client that advertises `lobby_protocol_version`, this number
///      does not gate lobby admission: both ends compare the LOBBY number
///      instead, and the client echoes the broker's own `protocol_version`
///      back (`openPhaseSocket.ts`) so the legacy window compares a value to
///      itself. On the LEGACY path it DOES gate, at both ends — the
///      `MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL ..= PROTOCOL_VERSION` window here, and a
///      client-side ceiling in `ws-adapter.ts` that runs BEFORE that echo —
///      so a client built in the window between the previous bump and the
///      lobby-owned version is evicted by this move. No RELEASED tag sits on
///      the legacy path with a `protocol_version` inside the post-bump
///      window; every released build still on that path is already below its
///      own ceiling and stays refused. Lobby gating lives in
///      `LOBBY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` / `MIN_SUPPORTED_LOBBY_PROTOCOL`, which
///      move to 2 alongside this bump for the `FormatConfig.deck_size`
///      retype — that pair is what evicts a released cohort; see its own
///      changelog entry for who and for what is lost.
/// 33 — `LegendCandidateIdentity::Unknown` prevents face-down legend candidates
///      from publishing an affirmative original/copy identity.
/// 32 — `DerivedViews::legend_candidate_identities` publishes the engine-authored
///      original/copy/token-copy identity for each active legend-rule choice. The
///      field is `#[serde(default)]`, but the client deliberately no longer derives
///      this rules-sensitive identity from raw objects; an older server would
///      silently omit every choice identity.
/// 31 — `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` publishes the engine-issued `declaration`, and
///      `InteractionResponseSpec::Shortcut` publishes `preview`, the per-axis
///      consequence of the offered count. Both are `Option` and neither type sets
///      `deny_unknown_fields`, so a v30 peer still *parses* the frame — this is a
///      capability bump like 24, not a parse bump. UNLIKE 24, no pairing is left to
///      exercise the gap, so this entry names no silent-drop hazard. Full-game floors
///      are exact-match on both sides (`server_core::MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL ==
///      PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and `MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_PROTOCOL` in
///      `client/src/adapter/ws-adapter.ts`), so a v31/v30 full-game pair is refused
///      at the handshake and never sends an action frame. The one-version window is
///      this file's `MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL` below, and it is lobby-only:
///      `DeclareShortcut` rides `ClientMessage::Action`, which `LobbyClientMessage`
///      has no variant for at all, and which `reject_if_disabled` in
///      `crates/phase-server/src/main.rs` answers under `ServerMode::LobbyOnly` with
///      an explicit rejection rather than a silent drop. The P2P games this broker
///      matchmakes are gated tighter still, on build-commit equality
///      (`check_build_commit`), not on a protocol window.
/// 30 — Serialized player-action completion provenance and modal continuations.
/// 29 — Added requester-correlated `ResolveAllRejected` response frames.
/// 28 — Added native `ResolveAll` request/result frames.
/// 27 — Added `DraftKind::Sealed`, serialized by draft WebSocket messages.
/// 26 — Added `ServerMessage::ActionNoOp` for accepted transport no-ops.
/// 25 — `DebugCardEntries` added a serialized, private resolution frame for
///      multi-card sandbox battlefield entries that pause for replacement or
///      as-enters choices. Old peers cannot deserialize that `GameState` shape.
/// 24 — `DerivedViews::unbounded_families` carries the engine-owned per-seat
///      family collapse state behind each `∞` badge. The field is
///      `#[serde(default)]`, so this is a capability bump rather than a parse
///      bump: the client deleted its row-flag OR-fold derivation, so a v23
///      server that omits the field would leave a new client rendering NO
///      infinity badges at all, silently and with no parse error to catch it.
/// 23 — `PayableResource::ManaGeneric` changed from `{ per_x }` to
///      `{ base_cost: ManaCost }` (#6410) — a `GameState` payload field type
///      change, and `base_cost` intentionally carries no `#[serde(default)]`
///      (a missing `base_cost` must fail deserialization, not silently
///      resolve to a zero-cost payment), so old and new peers can't parse
///      each other's serialized snapshots.
/// 20 — Actor-scoped priority-passing settings and filtered per-player state.
/// 19 — Connive's exact `EventObjectSnapshot` subject and resident paused
///      post-replacement drains changed serialized full-game state. Phase 4
///      later pinned the existing v2 resolution wire shape; it did not add a
///      second protocol change.
/// 18 — Serialized GameState trigger provenance and paused logical zone-change
///      owners are now wire-visible.
/// 16 — Meld pair/attacking-entry choices after mana-payment preview variants.
/// 15 — Mana-payment preview request/response variants.
/// 14 — `PrecastCopyShortcut` action and its two `WaitingFor` variants.
/// 13 — `WaitingFor::MulliganBottomCards` removed from the full-game state
///      payload; mulligan bottoming folded into a
///      `MulliganDecisionPhase::BottomCards` sub-phase on
///      `WaitingFor::MulliganDecision`.
