//! `TournamentManager` — the pure, WASM-safe tournament core.
//!
//! Functional core, no shell: every method here is a pure function of
//! `(&self`/`&mut self, .., env: &impl BrokerEnv)`. No tokio, no axum, no
//! `SystemTime::now()`, no `rand` — wall-clock time and token minting are
//! injected through [`BrokerEnv`] exactly the way [`crate::lobby`] already
//! does, so the identical logic runs in the native `phase-server` shell and a
//! Cloudflare Durable Object (WASM).
//!
//! Scope: this module is PR 1 of the tournament-organizer design
//! (`docs/proposals/tournament-organizer/PLAN.md` §4) — the algorithm and
//! state machine only. Deliberately absent, and deliberately NOT worked
//! around here:
//!
//! * No `Outbound`/`LobbyServerMessage` anywhere. [`TournamentManager::check_expired`]
//!   returns plain domain data ([`TournamentExpiryEvent`]), mirroring
//!   [`crate::lobby::LobbyManager::check_expired`]'s plain `Vec<String>`;
//!   wrapping those into outbounds is `Broker::reap_expired`'s job (PR 2),
//!   the same split that already exists for lobby games.
//! * No `Broker`/`ConnState`/protocol changes — PR 2.
//! * No worker shell or frontend — PR 3/4.
//!
//! Rules provenance. Two documents are cited throughout:
//! * **MTR** — the *Magic Tournament Rules* (Wizards of the Coast), the
//!   official document, cited by section (`MTR §2.1`, `MTR Appendix C/E`).
//! * **MSTR** — the *Multiplayer Addendum to the Magic Tournament Rules*, an
//!   **unofficial, independent-judge-authored** convention this design
//!   deliberately adopts because the official MTR has no
//!   multiplayer-pairing/scoring section at all. It is cited by name only:
//!   the source is continuous prose/tables, not numbered rule text, so there
//!   is no section number to cite (`RESEARCH.md` §13). It is never presented
//!   as Wizards policy.
//!
//! Neither is the Comprehensive Rules, so nothing in this file carries a
//! `CR` annotation: tournament administration (pairings, match points,
//! tiebreakers, byes, drops, retention) is not CR-governed game logic.
