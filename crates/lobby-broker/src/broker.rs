//! The functional broker core: `Broker::handle(conn, msg, env) -> Vec<Outbound>`.
//!
//! Mirrors the engine's `apply(state, action) -> events` reducer. No I/O, no
//! locking, no tokio: the only impurity is `env` (time/rng), `&mut self` (the
//! lobby map), and `&mut conn` (this connection's lobby state). The shell
//! interprets the returned [`Outbound`]s over its transport. **Output order is
//! significant** — the shell MUST perform them in returned order.
//!
//! This is the always-P2P path: there is no `is_p2p` / `mode` branch in the
//! core. The native shell only calls into the broker for the LobbyOnly-mode
//! dispatch (and the mode-agnostic Subscribe/Ping arms, whose behavior is
//! identical across modes), so every entry the core sees is a P2P entry.
