//! `LobbyManager` — the pure, WASM-safe registry of waiting lobby entries.
//!
//! Moved here verbatim from `server_core::lobby` (plan §2), with one change:
//! the two WASM hazards — `SystemTime::now()` (created_at / reservation
//! expiry / staleness) and `generate_player_token()` (reservation tokens) —
//! are replaced by [`BrokerEnv`] calls threaded into the methods that need
//! them. No game logic was altered; the unit tests carried over from
//! server-core (with a deterministic fake `BrokerEnv`) guard the behavior.
