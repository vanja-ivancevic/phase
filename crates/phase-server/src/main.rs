///     none of the by-value *parameter* sites (**41 production-reachable**; 48
///     in `crates/` total, of which 7 are test-only, and 13 of the 48 are in

///     `codegen-units = 16`) uses measurably more stack than `ai_commander`'s
///     profile;
///   * the cost is reserved *address space*, not committed memory. Note the
///     multiplier: `thread_stack_size` also sizes Tokio's **blocking** pool,
///     whose default cap is 512 threads, so the worst-case reservation for that
