//! Prometheus text exposition for the counters an autoscaler needs.
//!
//! Served on its own listener (`--metrics-port`), never on the public port: the
//! numbers here describe capacity and occupancy, which is operator information
//! rather than something a player should be able to read through the ingress.
//!
//! Hand-rolled rather than pulled from a client crate. The exposition format is
//! a handful of lines, the process has exactly one registry, and every value is
//! read live from state the server already holds — a registry abstraction would
//! only add a second place for a counter to drift out of sync.
//!
//! The occupancy gauges (`phase_games_with_connected_humans`,
//! `phase_drafts_with_connected_humans`) exist for one decision: a StatefulSet
//! always removes its highest ordinal, so an autoscaler must be able to ask
//! "does *this* replica still hold someone?" before it is allowed to shrink.
